Dustin Curtis on his new hand-rolled blogging system...

... go read the whole thing if you're interested in how other bloggers 
work. Dustin uses [Markdown][] and a minimal bare-bones (but stylish) UI 
for writing. His blogging UI is all about simplicity and zero 
distractions. He's decided to open up the software for use by a select 
handful of others. I've hummed and hawed about doing the same for my own 
(as yet un-named) blogging system but ultimately I just don't think it's 
ready for use by others (yet). What I can say for certain - I've been 
blogging a hell of a lot more since I began using my own home-brew 
system so there must be some merit in it.
