# Apple's Aesthetic Dichotomy

Over on the Made By Many blog - a great post about the Apple's split 
personality when it comes to hardware and software design...

> These designs are not the only evidence of an infantile aesthetic at 
> Apple. Jobs mentioned "emotion" when launching iAd (he meant 
> "sentimentality"), and Apple's own advertising regularly features 
> sickly-sweet "stories" containing grandparents talking long-distance to 
> their grandchildren on their iPhones and so forth. I understand: many 
> people like these things, they like emotion, however fake (these are 
> adverts they're scripted and acted; they are the opposite of authentic; 
> the emotion is false, corrupt, a lie) and they help to shift vast 
> numbers of devices.

> The locus of the infantilist aesthetic seemed to be Steve Jobs himself,

> trailers he used to demonstrate the video capabilities of the device? 
> Pixar movies. The music choices? Resolutely mainstream, conservative and 
> sentimental. At his recent memorial service on the Apple campus, 
> Coldplay and Norah Jones played. Can you imagine these artists playing

... Also worth reading are the comments. Wood can work in the right 
context but leather is never going to be a good look on a computer 
screen.
