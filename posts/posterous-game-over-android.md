# Game Over Android

<p>Look. It's really simple. I'm a punter looking for a new smart phone. What am I looking for in a new phone ? Well this comes a surprise to me but having played with an iPhone - it's all about the Apps. We must have spent about &euro;40 euro on iPhone Apps in the first week with my wife's iPhone. Apple's AppStore is a license to print money - they've made the process dead simple compared with Nokia's application ecosystem. In comparison, Android's App Market place is a flea market - See for yourself...</p>

<p>... and remember - this is a store which has Google's weight behind it. It looks like a short-term bet. </p>
<p>I'm in the market for a new smartphone and the decision I make will be based on which phone has the best Apps (much like the Windows vs. Mac decision made by millions of PC buyers in the 90s). For me this is a no-brainer. Apple's App Store runs rings around the Android marketplace.</p>
<p>I'm just one person but there are many others making a similar choice for the same reasons. Perhaps Google should take note.</p>
