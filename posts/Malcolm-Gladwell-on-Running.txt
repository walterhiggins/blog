# Malcolm Gladwell on Running## 2013/09/23 17:45> I went to the Millrose Games this year and watched Bernard Lagat. I had > no interest in the fact that he broke the American two-mile record. No > interest in the fact that he won, actually. I just wanted to watch him > run. It&#146;s the most beautiful thing I&#146;ve ever seen. I watched all the > other races, too. Even though I didn&#146;t know the runners in the high > school boys&#146; mile, the high school girls&#146; mile, you find there&#146;s always > someone that&#146;s just beautiful. And invariably that person wins, too. > There&#146;s just something about running. It&#146;s an elegant, riveting activity > to do and watch.>  > JS: You have said that your favorite distance is the 5-K. Why?>  > MG: Well, it&#146;s long enough that it has a narrative. In the same way that > the 1500 has a narrative, although it&#146;s compressed. The 1500 is a short > story. And the 5-K is a novel. You can see all kinds of things.>  > JS: So what would the marathon be? Tolstoy?>  > MG: That&#146;s right [laughs]. The marathon is Proust.   > -- [A Running Conversation With Malcolm Gladwell | Runner's World][1][1]: http://www.runnersworld.com/celebrity-runners/a-running-conversation-with-malcolm-gladwell?page=single## CategoriesRunning
