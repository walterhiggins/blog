  <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>The Net::SMTP::Server module implements an RFC 821 compliant SMTP server, completely in Perl. It's extremely extensible, so adding in things like spam filtering, or more advanced routing and handling features can be easily handled. An additional module, Net::SMTP::Server::Relay has also been implemented as an example of just one application of this extensibility. See the pod for more details on that module. This extension has been tested on both Unix and Win32 platforms.</p>

<p>Creating a new server is as trivial as:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>$server = new Net::SMTP::Server($host, $port);</pre></div>
</div>


<p>This creates a new SMTP::Server. Both $host and $port are optional, and default to the current hostname and the standard SMTP port (25).</p></blockquote>
