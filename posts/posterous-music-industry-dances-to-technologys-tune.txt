  <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">What is striking when chatting with any of the thousands of developers who&nbsp;are at SXSW is how many of those behind the latest software or mobile applications advancements are dyed-in-the-wool music obsessives. As Charles Slomovitz of&nbsp;the music sourcing website Shazam said&nbsp;in a recent New York Times interview: "We're living in a world where&nbsp;technologists and programmers are becoming the&nbsp;new gatekeepers for new music.</blockquote>

<p>I don't think anyone fully realises just what a big deal GarageBand for iPad is. I've used GarageBand and Ableton Live for Mac as well as a slew of different DAW software harking back to the Amiga in 1990. GarageBand for iPad feels like something entirely new under the sun - like perhaps the first wordprocesser or spreadsheet. 
<br />I am not a musician but I haven't been able to keep my hands off it since I downloaded it just 7 days ago. My 9 year old daughter uses it to sample her violin-playing and is quickly becoming adept at mult-track recording/composition. 
<br />GarageBand for iPad is a very big deal.</p></div>
