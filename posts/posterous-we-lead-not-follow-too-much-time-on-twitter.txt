<p>EmptyBottle.org's latest screed. As for Twitter, everything that annoys me about Twitter can be fixed by simply spending less time on Twitter. All twitter-related ailments can be neatly summed up as TMTOT (Too Much Time On Twitter). 
</p><p>Feel the need to vaguely vent at someone on twitter? You're spending Too Much Time On Twitter.
</p><p>Wish that twitter had some kind of filters so you don't see your friends tweets on topics you don't like? You're spending Too Much Time On Twitter.
</p><p>I could go on but you get the picture.</p></div>
