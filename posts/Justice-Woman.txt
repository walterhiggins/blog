# Justice - Woman ## 2017/04/17 14:47I've been a fan of French electronica duo Justice since 2008. I've loved both of their previous albums and just got their latest (Woman) on 7digital.com a couple of days ago. It's an album almost designed for previewing. It's full of sumptuous disco-tinged tracks which sound great for about 20 seconds and when previewed on sites like 7digital and iTunes, hint at great things which never actually transpire. The problem with Woman is that many of the tracks sound pleasant enough, but are lacking something vital - a chorus. It's all verse and bridge but lacks a killer chorus that would truly make it memorable. It's a pity because Justice have done some great things in the past. This album feels like they're coasting. It's good but not great.## CategoriesMusic
