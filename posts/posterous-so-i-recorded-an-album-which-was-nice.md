# So I recorded an album ... which was nice.

OK. I'm trying to pretend this isn't a big fucking deal but it is. For 
me at least.
I recorded an album. Yes. Me.
Relax. I haven't been signed up by a record label so I won't be 
troubling hotel TV sets any time soon. It all started exactly 3 months 
ago on my 40th birthday. Ursula bought me an iPad and shortly afterwards 
I bought the GarageBand app. GarageBand isn't perfect but it might just 
be perfect for me (and many others). Shortly after that I signed up to 
soundcloud.com and started uploading tracks as I worked on them. These 
musical rough sketches started to coalesce around a theme. I love The 
Orb's 'U.F.Orb' album and wanted to make something that would be the 
soundtrack to an interplanetary voyage. I failed, but it was fun trying. 
The results you can hear below.
A couple of points. The record hasn't been anywhere near a mixing desk 
so ... well if you're a sound engineer save yourself the pain and move 
right along. This album was cheap to record (no expensive studio time or 
producer) and distribute (It's in the process of being distributed 
through [cdbaby.com][1] so should end up in iTunes, emusic, amazonMp3 
etc in the coming days/weeks) so it will be correspondingly easy to 
download or buy if you so wish. You can download the album for free or 
you can purchase at a price that you decide at [http://saganism.bandcamp.com][2].
Now this all sounds very nice and utopian except for one small problem. 
Promotion. This is where being signed to a record label helps. I'm not 
going to even try that path. I'll be happy if friends listen to this and 
like it. It would be a bonus if anyone paid for it. As it stands I have 
no plans to give up the day job. Making money in music must be 
incredibly difficult. I can't imagine how frustrating it must be for 
bands/artists who are talented and willing to spend their time on the 
road touring to get their music heard.

I "designed" the album cover myself. If you're thinking "God that looks 
kind of home-made / bootleggy" well that's good. I wanted the cover to 
feel lo-fi to match the music. Yes this is electronic music but it is 
not polished. I'll probably do a follow up post on the nitty gritty 
details of barcodes and USC codes for tracks but for now I'm basking in 
the glow of just-released obscurity :-)
