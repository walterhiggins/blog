It's satire but this is also pretty much what I hear when people talk 
about Google+ or any new social network...

> You absolutely have to join YOGOL-it's this cool, new social media site 
> I just found out about! It's incredible. It takes all your current 
> social networking sites and builds on them to make your whole social 
> media experience so much better. Seriously, I have no clue how I ever 
> lived online without it.
>  
> Let me explain how YOGOL works. Basically you sign up through all your 
> current sites-Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Google+, LinkedIn, etc-and 
> YOGOL measures your usage to find out how much time you spend being 
> social online. Isn't that cool?! Haven't you always wanted to know 
> exactly how much of your one and only life you're giving to social 
> networks? I know I have!

> This thing will make me happier during my commute. Whether I take the 
> train or ride my bike, it will be there for me, and since it's 
> waterproof, I don't even need to worry if it's raining out. Making my 
> commute stress-free will go a long way towards making me happy.
>  
> Other people will look up to me because I own this thing and use it 
> frequently, which will make me very happy. When I'm at a party, for 
> instance, I can wait for a moment when people start talking about how 
> cool it looks from the latest advertisement. Then I can stroll over and 
> take it out and start using it, pretending that I hadn't heard their 
> conversation, and I can look up casually and wink at them. They're sure 
> to be impressed.
