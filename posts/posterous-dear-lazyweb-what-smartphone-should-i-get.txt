# Dear LazyWeb, What smartphone should I get?

<p>I picked up the Carphone Warehouse's April 2010 Buyer's guide this morning. There's a bewildering array of smart phones available now. I'm currently with Meteor Mobile and have a Nokia N95. I got it 2 years ago and it has served me well but...</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm paying over &euro;60 / year for Sat Nav on the N95</li>
<li>While the Maps app is useful, the non-touch interface feels clunky. This is where a touch-screen would really come in handy.</li>
<li>There doesn't appear to be a thriving App marketplace for Nokia devices. The iPad has piqued my interest in Apps - there seem to be some pretty decent apps I never knew of.</li>
<li>Nokia has decided to screw over N95 owners by offering free Sat-Nav on most devices <em>except </em>the N95.</li>
<li>While the N95 has wi-fi, the experience of connecting to the internet is <em>awful </em>. I have to enter my home wi-fi password <em>every single time </em>I want to browse the web.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here's what I would ideally like in my next phone...</p>
<ul>
<li>Music/Podcasts/Radio (I'm assuming these are now standard on even basic phones)</li>
<li>Wi-Fi / Internet Browsing</li>
<li>GPS and <em>Free</em> Sat Nav</li>
<li>Touch screen UI</li>
<li>Apps. Ideally some fun games / edu apps for the kids for car journeys.</li>
</ul>
<p>So from my limited exposure to mobile news ( you wouldn't believe how little I know about mobile phones ) , I gather I have two options...</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple iPhone (now free with 18mth vodafone billpay plan)</li>
<li>Android based phone (there's a couple of free and relatively cheap - &lt; &euro;150 - options on billpay plans)</li>
</ul>
<p>The apps market-place for iPhone makes it enticing but I don't know if it has GPS and free sat nav - does it? I've been hearing good things about Android-based phones but a tiny irrational voice inside my head keeps saying "It's not an iPhone" ( I know - I should really stop listening to those voices ). If I decide to get an iPhone it's relatively simple - There's only about 2 or 3 models. If I go for an Android, it's a little more complicated, there's ...</p>
<ul>
<li>HTC Hero</li>
<li>HTC Desire</li>
<li>Nexus One (not available in Ireland yet)</li>
<li>Sony Ericsson Xperia X10</li>
<li>LG Arena</li>
</ul>
<p>...to name a few. (I'm not even sure how many of these phones have GPS/Sat-Nav) . I don't think a Nokia/SymbianOS phone is an option any longer as there's no App marketplace. I'm not going to pay more than &euro;150 cos I'm on billpay so ... what phone should I get?</p>
<p> </p>
