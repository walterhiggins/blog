# Why is Apple's share price so low?

<p>Eventually Steve Jobs will no longer be CEO of Apple. Anyone who thinks this is no big deal and that Apple will stay on course once he's gone needs to see this...</p>

<p>I began work in Apple at the start of 1996. Jobs was still at Next and Apple hadn't yet acquired Next. This was one of the videos new recruits watched during induction. Safe to say this would not have been made under Jobs' watch. Jobs killed the clones shortly after returning to Apple. I hope Jobs can stay CEO at Apple for as long as possible.</p>
