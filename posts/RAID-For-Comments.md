This got me thinking ... [Conversation happens elsewhere][2] but not just on 
Facebook. It happens on G+ and Twitter too. The Facebook Social plugin 
only shows Facebook comments, what if it showed *all* comments striped 
across all social networks? That would be cool - a striped comment 
thread right there in your blog. Think of it as [RAID][3] for comments - a 
Redunant Array of Independent Comments. Does such a tool for bloggers 
exist? If not, **Someone Needs to Make This**.
