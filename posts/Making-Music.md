A must-read article on how pop music is made in 2012...

> Whereas rock is about the sound of a band playing together (even when 
> its members aren&#146;t actually together) and features virtuoso solos played 
> on real instruments, today&#146;s Top Forty is almost always machine-made: 
> lush sonic landscapes of beats, loops, and synths in which all the 
> sounds have square edges and shiny surfaces, the voices are Auto-Tuned 
> for pitch, and there are no mistakes. The music sounds sort of like 
> this: thump thooka whompa whomp pish pish pish thumpaty wompah pah pah 
> pah. The people who create the songs are often in different places. The 
> artists, who spend much of the year touring, don&#146;t have time to come 
> into the studio; they generally record new material in between shows, in 
> mobile recording studios and hotel rooms, working with demos that 
> producers and top-line writers make for them to use as a kind of vocal 
> stencil pattern.
