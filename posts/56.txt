I read the news of [Steve Jobs' death][1] on Robert Cringely's blog. The
title of the post was simply 'Steve Jobs'. I read the first few
paragraphs and it slowly dawned on me, the simplicity and import of
that title.
Fifty six is too young to die. Too young for a child to lose a parent,
a wife or husband to lose a partner and too young for a parent to
lose a son/daughter. I know this from personal experience. My mother died
aged fifty six. For a while after she died, I couldn't picture her
face in my mind. I can now. She is very much in my thoughts this
morning. 
There are two ways to achieve immortality. One, is to be remembered by
loved ones. My mother is remembered by all of us. She was the
lynchpin that held our family together. For my part, I'm passing
those memories on to my children. The other way to achieve immortality
is to inspire. Steve Jobs inspired - big time. 
Sometimes, when I'm running and the blood is pumping through my veins,
and I have music in my ears, I get a runner's high. The hairs on my
arms stand on end. The atoms in the air and my own body seem to be
dancing, teasing the boundary between skin and air, self and
universe. It is at once a moment of exquisite self-awareness and
selflessness. 
We live and die at the human scale. What looks like decay and death up
here at the human scale is actually a rapturous co-mingling of
atoms. At the sub-atomic scale, life - if you can call it that - goes
on. 
Matter, Energy, It's all good.
