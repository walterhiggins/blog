# The Web as Landscape## 2012/03/08 07:51I admit I only posted this because I love the analogy of The Web as Landscape...> The good news is that the architecture of the Internet is fairly robust > and there's nothing about the silos that have been built that keeps some > of the rest of us from striking out for the frontier and building a new > town. That's how I look at Personal Event Networks, a new town on the > frontiers of the Internet where a few hardy souls are hanging out at > present, watching the numbers slowly grow and hoping that we can build > up the roads so that others feel like the trip out to the boonies isn't > too arduous and therefore feel inclined to chance the journey.  > -- [Journey Out to Our Frontier | Phil Windley's Technometria][1]... Also - anyone who has ever played Sim City should feel a little tingle of recognition when reading that.[1]: http://www.windley.com/archives/2012/03/journey_out_to_our_frontier.shtml## CategoriesThe Internet
