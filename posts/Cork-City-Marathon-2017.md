# Cork City Marathon 2017## 2017/05/07 17:03Four weeks from today I'll be running the Cork City Marathon. It willbe only my 2nd Marathon. This one is a grudge match. I ran the samerace last year and finished in 4 hours 52 minutes. Not a great finishtime. I've been training for this upcoming one since late February and(knock on wood) the training has been going exactly [to plan][plan] sofar.This morning I finished my 2nd long run (17.4 miles) from home inBallincollig west of Cork City to BlackRock Village east of Cork cityand back. I had a great race two weeks ago - the Great Railway runfrom Cork to Carrigaline - a 25 Kilometer distance. I averaged 8:46per mile in that race - almost fast enough to revive hopes of a sub-4hour marathon. I'd need to average 9:09 per mile to do a sub-4marathon. I don't know if the legs, lungs, heart and training are upto that just yet.I have just one more long run - 20 miles next Sunday, then the Taperbegins. In the lead up to a Marathon it becomes all-consuming. Ifluctuate between thinking I can realistically do a sub-4. At the veryleast I hope to do a sub 4:30 . If I take longer than that I'll bedisappointed. There's a lot that can go wrong in a Marathon. Last yearI injured myself in Training - I ramped up the miles too quickly andtoo early. This year I've been sticking to a more conservative planwhich only increases mileage at a rate of < 10% per week. Last year,the day of the Marathon was quite warm. I held back for the first 5miles sticking to a 11 min pace. To be honest I was so nervous aboutthe injury and making it worse that I was just happy to get around thefull 26.2 miles. This year I have 3 time bands in mind.If I complete it in under 4 hours 30 minutes I'll be happy.  If I do it in under 4 hours 15 minutes I'll be happier.  If I do a sub 4 I'll be over the moon.  Just four weeks to go so we'll see.
