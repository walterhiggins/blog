# Tweeting 'In Absentia'
## 2012/02/19 08:26
There was a story went around the Net a couple of years ago. It goes like this...
Barbra Streisand was relaxing at home listening to the radio, when the 
show she was listening to breaks for Ads. She notices the sudden 
increase in volume during the ad break (which is common to Radio and TV 
- the volume is boosted during ad breaks) and rather than reach for the 
remote to lower the volume like a poor pleb like me would do, she calls 
the radio station to complain and insist they lower the volume on their ad breaks. I 
don't know if Barbra Streisand was successful in her plea to get the 
station to keep its broadcasting at an even volume (I doubt it) or even 
if this story is true. What I do remember is the collective rolling of 
eyes when the story broke a couple of years ago. The commentary went 
something along the lines of "Yup, That's something a pampered Diva like 
Streisand would do all right". 
What no one seemed to mention was that Barbra Streisand had a point.
I bring this up because yesterday I had one of my regulars rants about 
FourSquare cross-posts on Twitter, and got the usual response of "Use 
Filters!". FourSquare check-ins, mayorships, mayorship oustings, and 
badge award tweets are **Really Fucking Annoying (tm)**. Seriously, 
no one cares (except you and the mayor you just ousted) if you just 
ousted so-and-so as the Mayor of generic-coffee-shop. **No one**. In 
fact we Twitter folk would prefer if you FourSquare users kept that to 
yourselves. Why *can't* FourSquare users just - you know - keep it to 
themselves? Why does FourSquare continue to encourage cross-posting? 
Doesn't FourSquare already have a way to let connected FourSquare users 
know when they've checked in etc? The argument for cross-posting to 
twitter goes "It facilitates augmented serendipity by letting twitter 
users who might not be on 4sq know when their friends are nearby" but 
the counter-argument is this: if I'm interested I'll already be signed 
up to 4sq and will already have been notified so stop polluting my 
twitter stream. 
## Cross-posting and Auto-posting
Cross-posting is when you do some low-effort activity in Social Network 
A and it shows up in Social Network B. Auto-posting is when you create 
something (an audioboo recording, a video clip, a blog post - anything 
which requires creative effort) and share it on a Social Network. The 
difference is the effort required to create the content. So, 
Auto-posting is good but Cross-posting is bad.
## 'In Absentia'
I honestly think FourSquare users are completely fucking oblivious to 
just how annoying their 4sq tweets are, otherwise they wouldn't do it. 
And that's the crux of the problem, FourSquare users *are* oblivious 
because they are tweeting 'In Absentia', they are not really present on 
twitter when they cross-post from FourSquare. It's a fire-and-forget 
cross-post with little thought, information or personality put into it. 
Cross-posting from FourSquare is bad, for the same reason cross-posting 
across all social networks is bad - it betrays a fundamental lack of 
respect for the people you're connected to. Is the once in a blue moon 
serendipitous meet-up with a fellow FourSquare Jock worth the ongoing 
low-level ill will you've sown among your Twitter friends? Of course 
not. FourSquare users will still insist that it is. Look, I'm happy that 
you've accepted Location-aware Augmented Serendipity and Loyalty 
Discounts into your hearts, I really am, but FourSquare users are like 
Jehovah's Witnesses, I'm happy for you but please get off my porch.
