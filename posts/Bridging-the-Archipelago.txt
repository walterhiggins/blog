## No Blog is an Island
I spent a short time greping the blog's server log to find inbound 
links. That is - other sites which link to this blog. I was disappointed 
to see that while there are a few links from Facebook, the links aren't 
traceable back to the originating facebook post because facebook cloaks 
the referer url. So instead of the referer url looking something like this...

... it looks like this...

This makes it difficult for bloggers to see where Facebook traffic is 
coming from. What makes things worse for bloggers are URL shorteners. I 
get a lot of t.co referers but these are effectively useless in that 
they resolve to the destination URL not the refering/source URL. Slowly 
but surely, _the plumbing of the internet is being dismantled and I'm 
not sure I like what's replacing it_. 99.9% of the internet population 
don't care about such things (nor should they) but as an independent 
blogger I feel less connected because of these subtle changes.

I know intuitively that there has to be a better way - a way to 
converse and comment without resorting to walled-garden solutions like 
Twitter, Facebook, Disqus etc. I just don't know what that looks like 
yet. I think in Dave Winer's recent writing, he's reaching towards 
something. There is the germ of an idea which could make Facebook and 
Twitter as irrelevant in the 2010s as AOL became in the 2000s. Whatever 
it is - it will be up to us bloggers - we Island Folk - to build it. We 
need to [make it easier to establish a homestead][1] and once 
established, communicate with each other. One thing is for sure, it 
needs to be easier and more intuitive than [Trackbacks][2]. We need to 
be able to demonstrate to the inhabitants of Facebook and Twitter that 
island life isn't so bad. That our plumbing and telephones are 
as good as anything on the Facebook and Twitter mainlands. We're 
not quite there yet.
