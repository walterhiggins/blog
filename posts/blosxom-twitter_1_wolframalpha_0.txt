# Twitter 1 : Wolfram Alpha 0
## 2009/05/16 09:00
<p>
Today I got to play with a new-fangled search engine
called <a href="http://wolframalpha.com">Wolfram|Alpha</a>.
 For the skinny on what wolfram alpha is and what it can do you should
first go <a href="http://joedrumgoole.com/blog/2009/05/14/why-wolfram-alpha-is-a-game-changer/">read what Joe Drumgoole has to say about it</a>.
My favourite bit from Joe's post is this...
<blockquote>
Alpha brings all these pieces together to generate new information
from data as opposed to slavishly returning the mob results that
Google collects. This is information generation from first
principles. 
</blockquote>
Joe raises some good points about how and why Wolfram|Alpha offers
better answers to questions than google does. 
</p>
<p>
All the same Wolfram|Alpha will <em>never</em> come even close to
google's popularity. For me personally, Google's relevancy is waning
and has been for some time. Some online interactions today really
brought it home to me.

A couple of hours ago I was looking for an RSS feed for a channel on
YouTube and couldn't find one. In frustration I twittered...

<blockquote class="twitter">
<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/twitter_production/profile_images/140598800/flickricon2009_bigger.png" />
WTF YouTube has no RSS feeds. What year is this? 
</blockquote>

... and within a couple of minutes I got the following replies...

<p>
A couple of things to note...
<ol>
  <li>These were useful responses to a frustrated tweet. <em>I hadn't even asked a question!</em></li>
  <li>OK - "What year is this?" counts as a question but an obviously rhetorical one.</li>
  <li>Not one of my twitter friends answered "2009".</li>
</ol>

... Scoff if you like but Twitter is making serious inroads into
Google's territory. Google wants to expand its brief to not just
search but providing answers to questions. For kicks
I <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=WTF+YouTube+has+no+RSS+feeds.+What+year+is+this%3F">posted
  the tweet into Wolfram|Alpha.</a>
Despite all the claims made for Wolfram|Alpha it was stumped.

<p>
The same statement <a href="http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&q=WTF+YouTube+has+no+RSS+feeds.+What+year+is+this%3F">posted to google</a> doesn't provide much useful
information either.
</p>
<p>In 2009 Twitter's friend-powered search is beating google's
  index-powered search and Wolfram|Alpha's mathematic-powered
  search. If I were a M&A guy at google I know which plucky startup
  I'd be writing a cheque for.
