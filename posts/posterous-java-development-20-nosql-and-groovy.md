  <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">NoSQL datastores like Bigtable and CouchDB are moving from margin to center in the Web 2.0 era because they solve the problem of scalability, and they solve it on a massive scale. Google and Facebook are just two of the big names that have bought in to NoSQL, and we're in early days yet. Schemaless datastores <em>are</em> fundamentally different from traditional relational databases, but leveraging them is easier than you might think, especially if you start with a domain model, rather than a relational one.</blockquote>
