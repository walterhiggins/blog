# ScriptCraft and CraftBukkit - Opening up the Bukkit API to Javascript
## 2013/01/05 00:07

It's a first draft but I've got [ScriptCraft][sc] working now as a 
[CraftBukkit][1] Plugin. CraftBukkit is a Mojang-blessed Minecraft 
server implementation. You run CraftBukkit instead of the standard 
Minecraft Server. CraftBukkit has a fantastic API and adding plugins is 
as easy as dropping a file into a folder. I've updated the ScriptCraft 
source on github to include new bukkit plugin source code but if you're 
impatient or just want to get your hands on the plugin without having to 
compile or muck about with MCP, you can [download the binary here][2] 
and just drop it in your craftbukkit's plugins folder.
