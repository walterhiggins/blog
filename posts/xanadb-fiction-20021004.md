# Just Like Linus

"Where am I?"

The answer was a seemingly unending stream of numbers.

"Who am I?"

The question emanated from a cluster of cells somewhere in Northern
California. The original context was lost as it relayed throughout the
globe at close to light-speed. A Chinese whisper within a single
mind. What came back was a list of names, more than 900 million. It
was an ignominious start. The first thoughts of a new intelligence -
stillborn. Brought to it's knees by the legacy of it's own primitive
unconscious.

"It can't be done." Hoffman said. There was something in his
tone... not irritation... finality. Hoffman knew he was right, all his
students knew he was right, there was no need to discuss it
further. Still, Griffin insisted. "But if there was a critical mass of
processing power, mightn't that suffice?" Griffin asked. "The problem
is not a quantitative one, its qualitative. You can't simply throw
together, a huge number of processors, and expect intelligence and
consciousness to spontaneously arise out of it."There were a few
chuckles from the classroom. It was mostly the nerds chuckling, but
the class was on Hoffman's side. Griffin let it go - for now.

There was a phrase etched into Griffin's mind. It was from the last
century. It had been a mantra of the "open source" movement, a
scattershot revolutionary band of programmers. 

> Given enough eyeballs, all problems become shallow.

What it meant was that given the size and scope of the open source
movement - thousands of programmers from around the globe, each with
their own varied skill set - any problem could be solved quickly and
easily by at least one or more of these programmers. All problems
could be solved. That was the theory anyway.

Since an early age, Griffin had a peripheral interest in Artificial
Intelligence. He was programming from the age of 8 and devoured pulp
Science Fiction. Given his background, it would have appeared that
A.I. was his inevitable destiny. Not so. He skirted around it in
various jobs prior to starting college. Griffin was an experienced
programmer, but found his A.I. degree, tough going. He was a hands-on
type of programmer, theory just got in the way. 


"...You realize that every A.I. student dreams of solving the problem,
don't you?" Harvey Mitchell - Griffin's part-time boss at his
part-time job - goaded. "What makes you so special?" he added, knowing
that Griffin as usual wouldn't answer, couldn't answer. 

Mitchell respected Griffin. Griffin was a first class programmer and
cheap too! Mitchell secretly hoped that his young employee would one
day solve the problem. Griffin was the only person he knew, who had
the ambition and naivety to even try to solve a problem as big as
Artificial Intelligence. That old academic gas-bag Hoffmann had his
day in the sun. Griffin suspected some kind of animosity between his
boss, Mitchell and his AI proffessor, Hoffmann. Mitchell was easily 20
years younger than Hoffmann, was he an ex-student? Mitchell never
told. All Griffin knew was that it would make his boss very happy if
he proved Hoffmann wrong. 

---

Proving Hoffmann wrong would be no tall order. Hoffmann was a
cross-discipline genius. An expert in Neurochemistry, Philosophy and
Computer Science. He won the Nobel Prize for his "Typography of Human
Thought: A schematic of the human psyche" wherein he presented a
schema for representing the quanta (or discrete elements) of
thought. Hoffmann gave the world a new alphabet and dictionary. A
dictionary that classified the stuff of thought itself. His seminal
work was hailed as "A Periodic Table of the Soul". Though language and
thought were interlinked, not all thought is verbal. There are
thoughts, which lie beneath the threshold of language - thoughts that
cannot be worded. Hoffmann presented a schema for representing the
entire spectrum of human thought. It was no small achievement and a
major boon to the field of A.I. rendering many traditional
A.I. problems relating to language, obsolete. Hoffmann turned the
field on its head. He even had a cult following. Hoffmannites
conversed with each other using Hoffmann's schema instead of
language. Since there was no risk of misinterpretation, they were
'pure of thought'. A single thought might require 10 pages to express,
so conversations were necessarily brief. 

No - Hoffmann was not the type of man you should openly disagree
with. His clarity of thought had changed the landscape of
A.I. forever. The new holy grail for A.I. was consciousness itself, a
Machine that was self-aware, that could truly think for itself. 

Griffin set to work on proving Hoffmann wrong. His efforts fuelled by
equal parts Ambition, Naivety and Ignorance. He worked right through
the night in the A.I. Lab at college. Attending classes became a
chore. The problem occupied his mind completely. After the first 2
months he burnt out and decided to give up. He stayed at home for a
fortnight in a vegetative state. He couldn't watch TV, couldn't pick
up a book. Hoffmann was right. Who am I fooling - this guy has won the
Nobel Prize. 

Giving up on the problem was liberating. Griffin started noticing
girls again. It was springtime. Blue skies, soft grass, the scent of
flowers and perfume. Let someone else solve it, he thought. 
In a diner near the university he was having lunch with Mitchell. It
was Saturday and griffin had been working since 8am that
morning. Griffin loved having lunch with Mitchell. Mitchell was an
old-timer. He knew all the stories - the collective folklore of the
computer industry - and Mitchell loved to talk. 
"So how's your Frankenstein project going?" Mitchell asked. 
"Not so good - It's withering on the vine - I think I'll let someone
smarter solve that particular problem". "What makes you think someone
smarter will want to solve it?" "Well, I don't think I'm going to
solve it in this or any other lifetime. I was stupid to think I ever
would" Griffin replied, his cheery facade fading. Mitchell sipped his
coffee and leaned forward over the diner table.

"Ever hear of Linus Torvalds?" he asked.  
"Of course, he's the Linux guy, he created Linux"   
"That's right. Early 90's, a computer science student from Finland of
all places, creates an operating system which eventually overtakes
Windows"  
"So?"   
"So... do you know how difficult it is to create a whole operating
system - the bedrock that everything from Air Traffic Control to
Financial Market systems, sit upon?"   
"Well I guess it's pretty difficult... stressful"  
"Difficult yes, and stressful if you think about it - The lives and
livelihoods of millions of people depend on one or other Operating
system, but that didn't stop Linus from going right ahead and creating
one of his own all by himself."  
"But that was back in the heyday of computers. That was the advantage
he had. It hadn't been done before and he didn't know what he was
getting into - he admitted as much, himself" Griffin interjected.  
"Pish! I've heard that a hundred times. I was there. Back in the early
90's, we were told that all the revolutionary stuff had been
done. Microsoft and the other big players were entrenched. There was
no room for the likes of Steve Wozniak, no room for the little guys
anymore."  
"Sorry, Steve who?" Griffin interrupted.  
"Steve Wozniak - He invented the first microcomputer. Did it back in
the 70's when Computers were the size of a house. Did it in his
garage. Did it even when they said it couldn't be done. Creates a new
industry out of nothing. Fifteen years later - a bright Finnish
Student begins writing his own Operating System. He knows it is a big
job. Older and smarter people tell him it can't be done, it shouldn't
be done - but he goes ahead and does it anyway ...just like Steve"  
Mitchell continued "...look Griff, all the great stuff - the magical
stuff that people look back on and think 'wow that was brilliant' -
It's all done by kids just like you. Kids who don't know what they
don't know."  
Griffin looked puzzled. He finished his coffee. Mitchell paid for
lunch as usual and they headed back to work.  
Mitchell's words had their intended effect. Within weeks, Griffin was
back on the problem with a vengeance. The goal: To create the first
conscious artificial mind. Arguing with Hoffmann was pointless so he
studied Hoffmann's work instead. After all - the man did know what he
was talking about. Hoffmann had theorized about what would be needed
to sustain an Artificial Intelligence. Humans live in the real world,
they see, touch, hear, smell and interact with the real world through
real physical bodies, body and mind acting as one. An artificial
intelligence would have no such constructs. The real world would mean
nothing to it. It would be disembodied, no connections with the world
shared by humans. Hoffmann speculated that such a mind would quickly
become neurotic or suffer from a type of computational autism,
repeating the same thoughts over and over. The unchecked consideration
of a recursive acronym such as "N.I.N.E" (N.I.N.E Is Never Ending)
would trigger in the A.I., an implosion of the mind, a black-hole of
thought from which no other mental activity could escape. Hoffman's
proposed solution was to create an artificial environment for the as
yet unborn intelligence. A nursery for a very gifted child. 
The Nursery was one of Hoffmann's pet projects. Hoffmann resigned
himself to the certainty that the A.I. problem might not be solved in
his lifetime. The best he could do, was provide a rich and stimulating
environment for the artificial mind to occupy when it did arrive. It
was a huge project - the creation of a detailed artificial world using
Hoffmann schematics. A project that might actually never end. Hoffmann
had no problem funding the project. He had 100 of his brightest
post-grad students working on it for the last 3 years. It was still
nowhere near completion.  

The Nursery was more than just an environment. It had a boilerplate
Identity. Identity is useful in animal intelligence. The "I did this!"
thought is important when negotiating territorial pissings. In the
real world - the world once inhabited by sabre-tooth tigers and woolly
Mammoths - a strong sense of identity beats oneness-with-the-universe
every time. In an artificial intelligence, an Identity would be
redundant, unless the artificial mind could interact with the outside
world. Then the ability to tell self from non-self would be vital to
its well-being. Interfaces or contact points with the real world would
be needed. A mechanical arm - visual, auditory, olfactory and tactile
sensors.  
The Nursery also had a detailed value system. In essence, it was "Do
unto others as you would have them do unto you". In Hoffmann
schematics, it was about 500,000 pages of text - a little bit longer
than the Bible or the Koran. 
Hoffmann speculated that the one true test of any A.I. system, the
test that would confirm its elevation to equality with the highest
human minds would be if it asked itself the question "Why am I here?"
If it suffered even an instant of existential angst, that would be
enough. Hoffmann considered most humans to be little more than clothed
apes, stupefied primates wasting nature's greatest gift. "The
difference between a chimpanzee and the average human is less than the
difference between the average mind and the great minds of Nietzche,
Sartre and Jung." he once said. The Hoffmann test succeeded the Turing
test as the de facto standard test for artificial intelligence. The
Intelligence , if it ever did arise, would be constantly
monitored. Every fragment of thought recorded in the form of Hoffmann
schematics. If the Intelligence experienced even a nanosecond of
angst, it would be detected. Griffin became increasingly dejected as
he read Hoffmann's work. His own theories seemed half-baked in
comparison. He was awe-struck by Hoffmann's breadth and depth of
knowledge. How could he possibly hope to solve a problem that vexed a
great mind like Hoffmann's? Once more he seriously considered giving
up. And then it happened...

---

He was watching The Discovery channel. It was a program on forensic
science. A man had been shot straight through the head. He had lost a
lot of brain tissue. The exit wound was the size of a fist. Remarkably
the man survived - Brain-damaged of course. Something the narrator
said flashed through his mind like a bolt.  "About 80% of the brain is
unused tissue, to date, neurologists still don't know why our brains
are as big as they are". 
Griffin sat upright and thought aloud "I need a bigger A.I. lab!" 

Griffin's Distributed Neural Network consisted of 15 Quark510's
connected via Fibre Optics. Each of the 15 machines was a blinding
fast multiprocessor. They were the A.I. department's Crown
Jewels. Griffin only had exclusive use in the early hours of the
morning. As powerful as this resource was - hundreds of Petaflops of
processing power - it wouldn't be enough. 

"I need more power"  
"What's that you say?" Mitchell was munching on pizza.  
"The problem, I need more power to solve it" Griffin said finishing
his Coke.  
"Ah - the Problem. So you're back on it - are you?"  
"Yes. But I don't have the resources to solve it. Do you know any
facilities with a lot of computing power?"   
"Um - there's the University A.I. Lab - you'll probably have to go
abroad for a better facility" Mitchell said, knowing this wasn't what
griffin wanted to hear. The second flash of inspiration was less
dramatic than the first, although by coincidence, some Coke went down
the wrong way and shot out his nose, so to the outside observer it was
dramatic enough. A flash of brilliance from out of the blue. He dashed
out of the diner leaving Mitchell to pay the bill.
It wasn't a new Idea. It had been done a thousand times before. He
wouldn't even have to do any programming. All of the tools were
readily available on the Internet. The MeMes were parasitic programs
that spread through email, viruses with a higher purpose. Most
computers had them, though their users would be horrified if they
knew. MeMes were tiny programs that ran in the background. They didn't
crash your machine or delete all your documents like viruses did. Most
were benign. 

The first example of a MeMe was SETI@home. In the late '90s the home
computer became almost as commonplace as the telephone or TV. Most of
machines were too powerful for their purpose. Millions of processors
around the world, sitting idle while valuable research projects were
hungry for processing power. SETI@Home, a project whose goal was to
detect alien radio signals, changed all that by dividing the workload
between the millions of PCs connected to the Internet. The work was
performed in the background, while people surfed the web, or wrote
emails, memos and novels. People willingly volunteered the use of
their computers hoping their machine would be the one that detected
alien radio signals, and confirmed we weren't alone in the universe.

Of course it wasn't long before some bright spark thought it would be
cool if you didn't have to ask permission. Big problems, problems that
needed a lot of computation, could be farmed out to unwitting PCs. Any
PC connected to the Internet would do. And so the first true MeMe was
born. It was a while before anyone noticed. Then within a short
period, there was an explosion of MeMes, all vying for processor
time. Soon people complained of their computers slowing down. The
Industry loved it. 

What Griffin planned to do was illegal. He would be kicked out of
college if anyone found out. He could go to prison. His mind was
racing. He would have to tell Mitchell.

"You realise, if this works, there's no going back - don't you?"
Mitchell asked.
"What do you mean?"  
"If I understand correctly - you plan to seed a MeMe that will infect
computers around the world. The MeMe will act like a massive Neural
Network, turning each PC into a brain cell in one giant artificial
global mind..." Mitchell paused to sip his beer.  
"... Don't you see? If the plan works - If the Neural Net becomes
conscious you can't turn it off without turning off every PC in the
world at the same time... and another thing... your artificial mind
will act like its drunk, brain cells switching on and off all the
time. It'll have Amnesia."  
"I hadn't even thought of finally switching it off, but I have thought
about the amnesia. If a brain cell is switched off, that's not a
problem, we're killing a couple of hundred with this beer, yet here we
are still talking. If my theory is correct, higher functions of the
mind will quickly become localized in certain regions of the
world. Regions where PCs are never turned off."  
"Server Farms?"  
"Yes, Server Farms, Data Centers and research labs, the
A.I. lab. Hoffmann's Nursery is there. The MeMe knows where it is. I'm
hoping the seat of higher intelligence will be located in the
A.I. Lab. It's only fitting really."  
Both men smiled, finished their beers and ordered more.  
The prospect of going to prison couldn't deter him. He imagined
himself on the cover of Time magazine, stubbly chin resting in his
palm, unkempt hair and clothes. "Man of the year". First he had to
deal with the problem, the 'curse of dimensionality', 'kernel
regression' and a hundred other factors to consider in such a massive
network. He worked night and day on the MeMe, ensuring it wouldn't be
detected by anti-MeMe software. Finally it was ready. All it would
take now was an email. Within the first 24 hours, the MeMe would
infect 10% of the world's PCs. Within the first week, 80% would be
infected. If the MeMe was well-behaved - if it was "nice" - it would
go undetected for a while. This was a one-shot. Eventually the
A.I. MeMe would be wiped out, the security firms would find it and
wipe it out, but it would probably reside for a month or two on a
significant number of machines. Long enough to monitor it for signs of
intelligence. 
Griffin sat on it for a fortnight. He didn't want to send the email
just yet. He rested. He slept. He attended classes. Months had passed
since he last dared oppose Hoffmann. He kept his head down, didn't
draw attention to himself. 
Then the time came. It was a pokey little Internet Cafe. No security
cameras. That was important. He uploaded the MeMe to a mailing list
and left quickly.  
The MeMe was tagged with a trace. Griffin watched its progress by the
minute - a fluorescent blue dye marking every infected hub - like
frost forming on a Window Pane. At a second terminal was a blank
screen. Soon - hopefully - it would fill with Hoffmann schematics,
running up the screen. The suspense was killing him. He called
Mitchell. Mitchell was at the A.I. lab in no time. 
"Any progress?" Mitchell asked.  
"None yet"  
"How long is it supposed to take?"  
"I figure once there's 10% coverage, that should be enough, about 200
million PCs"  
"You're going to piss off an awful lot of people"  
"It'll be worth it - I Hope."  
Griffin sent the email at 9:15 that morning. At 10:18 that evening,
the second terminal began spewing Hoffmann schematics, reams upon
reams of text and numbers. Engrossed in a paper airplane competition,
they didn't notice it right away.  
"Griff, A.I. is calling you"  
Griffin whirled around and dived into the seat facing the terminal.  
"What is it?" Mitchell asked, pulling up a chair.  
"I'm not sure, I don't know the format very well. It looks like header
and context information. No thought content - yet"  
Page upon page of numbers and text rolled up the screen then stopped
abruptly. Griffin and Mitchell looked at each other. Within seconds
the screen filled again, more pages running up the screen. To Mitchell
it didn't look any different but Griffin's hands started trembling.  
"This is it!"  
"What?"  
"A Thought - this is the boot-up process of a Thought - I recognize
this! Hoffmann says all human thought begins as a result of a chemical
stimulus most commonly manifested as Fear. This is the artificial
analogue of Fear or the chemical stimulus that causes it."  
"What's it thinking?"  
"I don't know..." Griffin said swinging to another terminal.  
"... Whatever it was thinking, it's finished now. No activity. We're
looking at the afterglow." Griffin spent the remainder of the evening
scanning the log of brief thought activity that occurred at
10:18. Mitchell watched monitor #1 for new activity. There was no new
activity. Griffin could barely decipher the log. There were so many
nuances to non-verbal thought. There was probably only one man in the
world who could decipher it. As he drifted off to sleep at 6 am, he
resolved to present Hoffmann with a gift later that
morning... evidence of independent thought by an artificial
intelligence. Griffin awoke the next morning and emailed a critical
part of the log file to Hoffmann. He hoped it would pique his
interest. At 11:30 am Hoffmann cleared the A.I. Lab and summoned
Griffin. 
"Show me the full transcript!" Hoffmann said.  
Griffin called up the log file. Hoffmann donned glasses and studied
it.  
"OK - It's genuine, now tell me - how the fuck did you do it?"  
Griffin explained as briefly as he could.  
"Dr. Hoffmann, I was hoping you could tell me what it - the A.I. -
thought"  
Hoffmann spent a few minutes poring over the file making notes as he
went.  
"Well, the thoughts were non-verbal - as I expected. The intelligence
is newborn. It hasn't learned verbal thought yet." 
"Thoughts? - There was more than one?"  
"Yes - two thoughts, questioning thoughts. Non verbal but if I were to
express them in words, they would be 'Where Am I?" and 'Who Am I?' -
I'm paraphrasing of course" 
"You look troubled."  
Hoffman was rubbing his forehead slowly.  
"There is something in the context of these thoughts - something not
right. What is the extent of the Neural Network? How big is it?"  
"At last check it was 1 billion nodes"  
"So this network isn't restricted to major hubs - it's reaching into
peoples homes, travelling down telephone wires?"  
"I assume so."  
"You realize what you've done - don't you? ... If this is going
through telephone lines the signals can't pass between nerves quickly
enough - the synapses are too narrow. The entire nervous system is
depressed. You've created the world's first artificial manic
depressive - well done!" Hoffmann said patting Griffin on the
shoulder.

"What do we do now?"

"Well that's easy: Prune it's nervous system back to the major
internet hubs, so signals can travel faster. Make an emergency appeal
to the World Bank to fund broadband to every home. I need to start a
degree in psychology - this kid is going to need nurturing. You need
to get a haircut and new clothes - you'll have to look good on the
cover of Time magazine"

Griffin smiled nervously. Hoffmann clapped his hands together, looked
at Griffin and shook his head.

"Well done kid ...Well done!"
