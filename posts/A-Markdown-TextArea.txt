# A Markdown TextArea
## 2011/09/30 00:14
One of the things I love about markdown is its simplicity. It is, by
design, constrained to the most commonly used email text conventions.
This simplicity means it doesn't get in the way of your writing. It
forces you to focus on content over style. 
 
While I love Emacs as a writing environment, one of the things I wanted
to have in this bootstrapped blogging system was an online post
editor. Not a WYSIWYG editor mind you - those things drive me nuts and
are another example of what I call *Forgetting Machines* I'm a
programmer and trying to post a snippet of code using wordpress or
posterous is a hair-pulling exercise.

Look at all those buttons! So many formatting choices you could easily
forget what it was you wanted to write in the first place. I wanted to
make a bare-bones textarea that allowed me to do some of the most
common markdown tricks with ease - Block-Quoting and Indenting blocks
of text by 4 spaces to convert them to `<pre><code>` sections.

It's simple and (ahem) unadorned but it gets the job done and saves me
hours fiddling with escape sequences and the edge-cases of other
online blog text editors. I'm a developer so being unable to post code
snippets to my blog without tearing my hair out[1] in frustration is a
deal-breaker, sorry Wordpress and Posterous.
