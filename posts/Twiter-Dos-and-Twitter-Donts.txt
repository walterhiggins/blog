# Twitter Dos and Twitter Don'ts
## 2011/10/26 09:09
Next month I will be 5 years on Twitter. I've more or less followed
these rules to stay sane while using Twitter. Your mileage may vary. 
## Don't Follow
As a rule of thumb I don't follow any of the following...
  1. Social Media Gurus  
     This should be self explanatory.
  2. People who moan about the presence of Social Media Gurus.  
     Sadly such people are as numerous and annoying as the SMGs
     themselves. A useful tip if you are annoyed by the Social Media
     Gurus on twitter; Don't follow them. Twitter is what you make
     it. It's different for everyone. If you are following someone who
     annoys you then - in the words of the prosaic doctor - don't do
     that. If you don't follow social media gurus but are annoyed by
     their mere presence on twitter - keep it to yourself.
  3. Celebrities  
     ... Unless their Twitter output is interesting and/or
     funny. Surprisingly few celebrities satisfy either
     requirement. There are exceptions of course [@SteveMartinToGo][1]
     is often funny and whimsical and well suited to twitter's terse
     limits. 
  4. People who moan about "Some People"  
     As in "Some people have a bee in their bonnet this morning". If
     you're the kind of person who talks like that on twitter, I more
     than likely would not want to spend time in your company in real
     life.
  5. Cross-posters  
     People who post updates to their facebook account and use
     software to automatically post such updates to twitter, G+ and
     whatever the latest social network is. This isn't the same as
     autoposting which is perfectly fine. If you have a blog / other
     stuff going on that can't be contained within 140 characters,
     chances are - if I'm already following you on twitter - I'm
     interested. So; cross-posting: Bad, auto-posting: Good.
## Filters
I don't use them. Many of the people I follow love Soccer, Rugby, the
Late Late Show, and X Factor, none of which interest me much. If I
were a power user I'd probably use a dedicated Twitter client
application that had filters to block out football related tweets. I'm
not a power user so I usually just do something other than watching
twitter on Saturday afternoons. Doing something other than spending
time on twitter has proven to be the most efficient filter.
## Numbers
They're not important. After five years on twitter I follow just under
100 people. I have at times followed up to 200 but that wasn't
sustainable. Time is precious so I had to cut back. According to
twitter there are over 1,000 people following me. That would be
flattering if it were true. The reality is many of those 1,000 are
either bots, dormant or the kind of people who follow hoping for a
follow-back.
## Power use
Not for me. I would hate to be a power-user of twitter. I realise
there are perfectly respectable power-use-cases (Journalism, Public
Relations, Customer Service etc) but would hate to have to use
twitter heavily as part of my job. I have of course used the
twitter API and have developed [Twitter Applications][2] but that
does not make me a power user.
## Trending Topics
I am peripherally aware that there exists a subculture on twitter
which slavishly follows trending topics. I haven't much more to
say. 
## TLDNR;
Twitter has much to recommend it if used sensibly.
