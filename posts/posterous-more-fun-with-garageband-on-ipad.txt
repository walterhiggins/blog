<p>Ack! The file includes tracks I had on mute. This sounds even worse than  I thought. Move along. Nothing good to hear here.</p>

<p>I can't tell you how much fun I'm having with GarageBand for iPad. Last year people (including me) were saying iPad was a consumption only device. I was wrong. GarageBand is the iPad's killer app. Worth getting an iPad for GarageBand alone. As you can tell if you're brave enough to listen, I am not a musician. I can only imagine what someone who doesn't have ears of cloth could do with this. An 8 track recorder, sampler and multiple-instrument digital audio workbench that you can hold in your hands? Truly we are living in the future.</p>
