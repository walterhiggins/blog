'The Vandenberg Bobble' was recorded in France last summer. I was reading Vernor Vinge's 'Across Realtime' at the time. The Vandenberg Bobble is a fictional structure - a Silver sphere 20km across just off the coast of silicon valley. 
'Reasons' was recorded just moments ago. I'm at home minding Sean who's feeling sick. All tracks recorded using Garage Band for iPad. I spent another while this morning messing about with the Korg iMS20 app but just can't get my head around it no matter how much I try.
