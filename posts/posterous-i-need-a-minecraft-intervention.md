Last night I had my first MineCraft dream. As dreams go, it wasn't exciting or even memorable. I have a vague recollection of just pottering about, digging here and there. The humdrum ordinariness of the dream is a sure sign that MineCraft has completely taken hold and furrowed deep neural pathways in my brain.

When we're not playing MineCraft, Kate and I watch MineCraft videos on YouTube, mostly blinged-out MineCraft cribs and underwater lairs worthy of a Bond villain. A few days ago we discovered another genre of MineCraft Video - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=minecraft+tnt+explosion">the TNT explosion</a>.

It is a measure of the game's wide appeal that it has spawned so many genres and sub-genres of videos on YouTube. This is one of my favourite 'Crib' videos - it goes badly wrong about halfway through...

(by the way - check out the viewing stats on all these videos - minecraft is a bona-fide YouTube phenomenon)
This video is gorgeous and hypnotic. It demonstrates MineCraft's dynamic landscape creation. When you're playing MineCraft, the world about you is terraformed-as-you-go. MineCraft's world is about *8 times the surface area of planet Earth!*...

Finally, I think the following best describes MineCraft's hard-to-pin-down appeal (If Don Draper from Mad Men were pitching MineCraft, this is what it might read like)...
> ...I want to call attention to MineCraft's extrinsic narrative. It's 
> minimal, implicit, accidental and very powerful. It's this: you wake 
> alone beside an endless sea in a pristine, infinite wilderness. The 
> world is yours. You can literally sculpt mountains, with time and 
> effort. You'll die and be reborn on the beach where you woke first. 
> You'll walk across the world forever and never see another face. You can 
> build a whole empire of roads and palaces and beacon towers, and the 
> population of that empire will only ever be you. When you leave, your 
> towers will stand empty forever. I haven't seen that surfaced in a game before.

p.s. If this fan-made trailer doesn't set your pulse racing then you are dead to me.
