# Bonsai Programming## 2014/01/07 10:39> Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.Also known as [Personal Programming][pp], or Programming in the small, or Software Carpentry or Pet-Project Programming. I've been doing a lot of Bonsai Programming over the Christmas break. You would think that my programming day-job would be enough and that the last thing I'd want to do for relaxation would be more programming, but the opposite is true.  Programming in the Small offers a refreshing break from Programming in the Large. Bonsai Programming is a chance to focus on refining and perfecting a small system of your own design. A system where you are the end-user, the architect, the key stake-holder, the product manager, project manager and software developer all rolled into one. Bonsai Programming offers a chance to start with a clean slate, to 'do things right', to hone and tweak, to refactor with impunity, to play [code golf][cg].For me personally, Bonsai Programming is what I do to unwind. Some people play computer games, I prefer to write computer programs. It's been like that since the early days when I first realised that programming my first computer (a [ZX Spectrum][zx]) was infinitely more fun than playing games on it. My current Bonsai ( [ScriptCraft][sc] ) has been as much about tweaking and honing the [documentation][doc] as it has been about coding. I've been fortunate in that ScriptCraft has attracted interest from other developers and contributors, and has a small user-base. These past few days I've had to constantly fight the urge to write new code and instead I've been documenting code which was long overdue documentation. If ScriptCraft is to grow, it needs better documentation, better example code, a compelling killer mini-game ... the list goes on. Where was I? Oh yes, Bonsai Programming is something I do to unwind. Returning to work and programming in the large after a sustained period of Bonsai Programming throws into sharp relief the differences between the two. There's a tension between the two types of programming. I'm seasoned enough to understand the need for all of the artifice and ceremony that comes with programming in the large, and still naive enough to hope that Bonsai programming is more than mere folly.[pp]: http://prog21.dadgum.com/77.html[cg]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf[sc]: http://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft [doc]: https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/tree/master/docs[zx]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum## CategoriesProgramming
