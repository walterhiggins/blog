# Who starts a blog in 2011?

## 2011/11/10 16:24

Who in their right mind starts a blog in 2011? Isn't the blogosphere 
already over-crowded and hasn't it been so since 2005? With so many 
bite-size nuggets of content crowing for attention, why would anyone 
consider adding their voice to the cacophony? I read this old Nicholas 
Carr essay from 2006 and I felt a twinge of bitterness - the bitterness 
I felt around the time I first gave up blogging in 2005.

How quaint that question seems now; "How to get a link from an A-List 
blogger?". Today, blogging has been subsumed by activity on social 
networking sites. It seems fewer people have the time to read blogs and 
the power once wielded by A-List bloggers seems diminished. My reasons 
for starting up the blog in 2011 were very different from the reasons I 
started blogging in 2002. This time it isn't about reputation or 
establishing an online identity. *There is less desire in me now*. I 
don't worry about who and how many read the blog. All the typical 
blogger preoccupations from the bad old days are gone. Analytics, 
Traffic, SEO, Page Rank, Comments - I used to give a damn about these 
things. I've come out the other side of the great collective ennui that 
engulfed blogging in the mid noughties, happier and with a less 
jaundiced view of blogging. Perhaps it's something blogging had to go 
through.

I'd like to know if Nicholas Carr has a different, less jaundiced view 
of blogging today than when he wrote his essay in 2006.
