<p>The idea of a full-length Lego movie definitely has legs. I just don't think it will work with a non-licensed unknown like 'Clutch Powers'. If Lego talked to George Lucas about licensing Star Wars or Indiana Jones for a spin-off Lego movie then they'd be on to a winner. 
<br />How do I know this?
<br />My 3-yr old *loves* the cut-scenes in the Lego Star Wars and Indiana Jones games.</p></div>
