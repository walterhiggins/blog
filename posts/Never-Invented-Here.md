# Never Invented Here 

## 2015/03/29 11:32

Michael O. Church on the 'Never-invented here' syndrome prevalent in Software development organisations:

> if engineers are micromanaged to the point of having to justify weeks&nbsp;or 
> even days of their own working time, not a damn thing is ever going to 
> be invented, because no engineer can afford to take&nbsp;the risk; they&#146;re 
> mired in user stories and backlog grooming. The core attitude underlying 
> &#147;Agile&#148; and NeIH is that anything that takes more than some insultingly 
> small amount of time (say, 2 weeks) to build should not be trusted to 
> in-house employees.

... and the problems of job satisfaction and employee retention in same: 

> In a never-invent-here culture that just expects programmers to work on 
> &#147;user stories&#148;, the programmers who are capable of more are often the 
> first ones to leave.

The whole blog post is very nuanced and well worth a read. I'll leave with this...

> The failure, I would say, isn&#146;t that technology companies use 
> off-the-shelf solutions for most problems, because that is quite often 
> the right decision. It&#146;s that, in many technologies, that&#146;s all that 
> they use, because core infrastructure and R&D don&#146;t fit into the 
> two-week &#147;sprints&#148; that the moronic &#147;Agile&#148; fad demands that engineers 
> accommodate, and therefore can&#146;t be done in-house at most companies. The 
> culture of trust in engineers is not there, and that (not the question 
> of whether one technology is used over another) is the crime.
