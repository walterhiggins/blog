# Double Bill Cinema
## 2011/07/16 05:22:00 
I've been pairing movies in my head for a long time. When I was 11 years old I went to see a double bill of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Mary Poppins' in the Odeon cinema in Dublin. An unlikely double bill  - I know. If I were running a small cinema, here's some double bills I'd show...
## The Matrix // Office Space
The protaganist in each movie seeks to find escape from his humdrum 9 to 5 cubicle-dwelling existence. Both movies were released within a year or two of each other. One is science fiction, one isn't. The same, but different. The only question is, which would you show first?

## Fight Club // American Beauty
The protagonist in each movie seeks to solve that age-old problem: How to be a man. Both movies were released within a year of each other. One is violent, one isn't. The same, but different.

## RoboCop // Wall Street
The protagonist in each movie finds himself the victim/tool of 80's american capitalism. Both movies depict the rotten core at the heart of american capitalism. Both movies were released within a year of each other. One is science fiction, one isn't. The same, but different.

You get the idea now. Two movies, released within a short time of each other, with similar themes but different approaches.
Any other suggestions?
