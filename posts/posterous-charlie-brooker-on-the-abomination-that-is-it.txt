<p>Here's a familiar, mundane scenario: you've got an iPhone with loads of music on it. And you've got a laptop with a new album on it. You want to put the new album on your phone. But you can't hook them up and simply drag-and-drop the files like you could with, ooh, almost any other device. Instead, Apple insists you go through iTunes.</p>
<p>Microsoft gets a lot of stick for producing clunky software. But even during the dark days of the animated paperclip, or the infuriating ".docx" Word extension, they never shat out anything as abominable as iTunes &ndash; a hideous binary turd that transforms the sparkling world of music and entertainment into a stark, unintuitive spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Plug your old Apple iPhone into your new Apple Macbook for the first time, and because the two machines haven't been formally introduced, iTunes will babble about "syncing" one with the other. It claims it simply MUST delete everything from the old phone before putting any new stuff on it. Why? It won't tell you. It'll just cheerfully ask if you want to proceed, like an upbeat robot butler that can't understand why you're crying.</p>

<p>+1 <br />iTunes is user-hostile software. How Apple get away with this I don't know. If you think iTunes is suitable software for managing your music collection / player, I've got news for you - you're suffering from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome">Stockholm syndrome</a>.</p>
