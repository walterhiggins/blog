## New York, JFK Airport: The near future.

"Here are your finalization papers sir"  
Aaron Moore didn't hear the clerk at the check-in desk. He was
distracted by a large billboard above the departure gates. It pictured
an elderly, vaguely ethnic gentleman looking pleased with himself. The
picture was captioned. "The best way to travel? ...Don't travel at
all!"  

"Sir...your papers"  
"Hmmm? ... What are these for?" He asked, absently thumbing through
the papers. 

"Our staff will answer any queries in the Transfer lounge. Your
luggage arrived in London this morning and will be ready for
collection when you arrive. The Transfer lounge is situated in
terminal 5 - enjoy your trip sir". 

Aaron Moore thanked the clerk, took his papers and headed through the
bustling crowd to the Transfer lounge. A billboard above gate 15
proclaimed "QED Air Congratulates Seymour Flynt, our 100,000th
passenger". A crowd of teenage girls gathered outside the Transfer
lounge awaiting the latest boy band sensation. Balding, middle-aged,
and attired in a dark suit, Aaron Moore felt self-conscious passing
through the screaming teenagers. 

Arriving in the Transfer lounge, self-consciousness was replaced by
stunned awe - the opulence of his new surroundings was
overwhelming. The floors and walls were all ornate marble. The
opulence was almost criminal. It was like the Taj Mahal brought to
JFK.

A well dressed young man approached Aaron Moore and offered to take
his jacket. 

"Mr Moore, Welcome to QED Air's Transfer Lounge, as this is your first
trip we'd like to welcome you to an orientation session where we will
explain our travel procedures. Afterwards, sir might like to avail of
our Recreational facilities." The young man was English and very well
spoken. 

Aaron Moore followed the young man down a busy corridor. They came to
a double-doored room and entered. Inside was a small intimately lit
theatre. Sitting at the front, chin resting on hands, was a
distinguished looking elderly gentleman. 

"This is John Peek, he will be your orientation guide - have a
pleasant trip sir" said the young man leaving. With that, the old man
stood up and offered his hand.  
"Mr Moore, We've been looking forward to meeting you, John Peek's the
name".  
"Aaron Moore - nice to meet you".  
"Have you taken a look around yet?" In his demeanour the old man was
courteous, he gave the impression he was genuinely interested in
people.  
"No. I'm expected in London shortly. I must take a look on my next
trip" Aaron Moore answered more tersely than he had wished. He was
wound up about the trip and, not by nature an amiable man, hadn't
foreseen making much small talk.

"You know, we've got quite a facility here - you must take a look
around next time" said the old man.  
"...OK Mr. Moore, I can sense you're eager to get to where you're
going so we'll get down to business - take a seat please". The 2 men
sat down opposite each other. 

"Mr Moore - can I call you Aaron? - Unless you've been living under a
rock the past couple of years, you know that the journey you're about
to take is no ordinary transatlantic flight...You also know that QED
Air, in its 10 years of operation, has become the world leader in
global travel, with an unsurpassed reputation for comfort and safety
... now that the corporate spiel is out of the way, let me explain the
nature of your journey - QED Air as you may be aware, is not an
airline in the traditional sense. For a start, we have no Airplanes.  

For the past 10 years we have been the sole commercial operator of
sub-quantum transfer technology. Sounds complicated - doesn't it? -
Well I can tell you that it is! Now... we have a little video here
that explains the science of what we do, but between you and me, I
have a PHD in Supersymmetric Particle Physics, I studied under
Feynmann at Caltech, but I still don't understand this new stuff..."  
"Teleportation" said Aaron Moore.  
"Yes...that's what the media likes to call it" Peek replied
pensively.  
"Anyway...since no Airplanes or Vehicles are involved, you'll arrive
at your destination in no time at all. Now to pre-empt a couple of
questions you may have - No there have been no accidents in QED Air's
10-year operation. Sub-quantum transfer is safer than any other form
of travel. You are no doubt aware of the controversial Instantiation
Laws passed more than a decade ago and the implications this has for
those who elect to travel by sub-quantum transfer. Let me reassure you
that there have been no fatalities as a result of QED Air's abidance
by these laws. Apart from temporary disorientation and in some cases
Nausea, there are no long-term physical or mental side effects. Before
transfer, you will be required to take a small dose of laxapaq, this
is a fast-acting laxative, its effects are instant but short-lived. I
trust you have adhered to QED Air's recommendation of not eating
within 3 hours before transfer. Before entering the transfer booth,
you will be weighed and various metrics taken, you will be required to
undress and remain stationary during the transfer process. Suitable
garments will be ready at your destination. If your luggage is not
ready on arrival, QED Air will provide suitable clothing and
recompense..." 

Peek's tone of voice veered wildly between monotone and exuberance as
he spoke. The effect was nauseating. Moore felt compelled to stop him
speaking.

"...Um sorry, I have these...'Finalization' papers here - I was
wondering if you could go over them with me, there's a lot of legal
jargon"  
"Sure, they are nothing to worry about, you'll need to sign them and
present them to Council who will be present at the transfer booth".  
"...But what do the papers mean? - I'm not signing my life away - am
I?"  
"Hmph - In a manner of speaking... No. These are Finalization
papers. The Instantiation laws I mentioned, require them. What it
means is that when you arrive at your destination, you will have the
same legal status that you had prior to departure. As Aaron Moore you
will be protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. You
understand that in the transfer process, a new instance of yourself is
created at your destination. This instance is for all intents and
purposes - YOU, same body, same mind, and same memories. We ask all
passengers to close their eyes and count backwards from ten to
zero. During the countdown, passengers are transferred to their
destination. No one has ever lost count!" John Peek was now looking
Aaron Moore straight in the eye, with a mix of fatherly concern and
calculation. He didn't like what he saw. Aaron Moore was nervously
thumbing through the papers. 'I'm losing my touch' John Peek thought
to himself. 

"Aaron ... Mr. Moore ... would you like to take a few minutes? Most
first time travellers are a little nervous. Its only natural..."  
"No, I'm fine" Aaron seemed to snap out of himself. "Where do I sign?"

---
The laxative was presented in a plastic cup. He was advised not to
take it until in the men's room. Two attendants stood by the sinks,
towels draped over forearms. He composed himself before leaving the
cubicle and washed his face in the ornate marble sink. 'hmmm - need a
shave' he thought, straightening his tie in the mirror. He took a warm
scented towel, barely acknowledging the hand that offered it. John
Peek was waiting outside. 

"Feeling OK?"  
"Yes, fine thanks"  
"Lets get you prepared then - we'll go straight through. There will be
an Operator and Council Member present in the booth while you undress
and body metrics are taken - If you wish, you may undress in complete
privacy but the operator and council must be present during the
measurement and transfer process. Please present Finalization Papers
to Council just prior to entering the transfer chamber. An operator
and Council member will also be present when you arrive in London. The
Booths here and in London are exactly the same. Every attempt has been
made to ensure that the immediate environment - lighting, temperature
etc - in both locations is identical. Nevertheless you may experience
short-term disorientation and/or Nausea shortly after your arrival in
London - this is to be expected. On arrival you will undergo a brief
physical and psychological examination. You and your luggage will be
transported by limousine to your hotel. Have a nice trip." 

John Peek gave a firm handshake. Moore's hand felt limp and
lifeless. As he undressed, his clothes were taken and his papers
checked. Here in this dimly lit room, naked and about to be atomised
half way around the world, he was feeling overwhelmed and a little
afraid. He had not expected the experience to be so clinical. Through
the wonders of science, the equivalent of open-heart surgery was about
to be performed on every atom in his body. The hairs on his body stood
on end, bristling with expectancy. It would all be done in an instant
and when it was over, he would be 1000s of miles away. Far from home,
his wife and children. He started trembling. 

"Mr. Moore - please step into the chamber." the Operator said.  
Aaron Moore stepped into the chamber - he was still trembling.  
"Mr Moore - when you're ready, we'd like you to close your eyes and
count backwards from 10 to zero".  
Unsure if he would ever be ready, he closed his eyes and started
counting.  
 10.

## London, The Millennium Dome

When Aaron Moore opened his eyes, the thought occurred to him that he
was the victim of an elaborate hoax. His surroundings hadn't
changed. The Operator and Council member were different. They could
have been swapped while his eyes were closed. The Operator looked
concerned. The Council Member beckoned him out of the chamber, holding
a hospital gown. 

"Welcome to London Mr. Moore. A doctor will examine you shortly. If
you feel dizzy or nauseous at any time, please let us know and we will
do all we can to make the remainder of your journey as pleasant as
possible."

Aaron Moore stepped out of the chamber into the hospital gown. For a
moment he felt a vague sense of unreality, like he was slipping in and
out of a dream. The moment passed and he was ushered into the
examination room. He picked up an issue of 'Time Out' lying on the
Doctor's desk.

## New York, JFK Airport.

Aaron Moore opened his eyes. The operator was on the phone. It was the
same operator but he looked ghostly white. The council member was
first to speak.

"Mr. Moore there's been a slight problem. We'll need you to wait a few
moments and then we can repeat the procedure. Its nothing to worry
about."

"What happened? I'm still in New York - right?"  
"Yes, this will take just a few moments".  
Aaron Moore donned a hospital gown and was ushered into a small dimly
lit room. He picked up an issue of 'The New Yorker' lying on a coffee
table. 
In the departure booth pandemonium broke out. The New York operator
was talking to the London operator. 
"We haven't finalized here!"  
"What? Are you insane? We have Mr. Moore undergoing tests here in
London - what happened at your end?"  
"He wasn't atomised, he's still here!"  
"No he's not, Mr. Moore is here in London. Whoever you have there is
no longer Mr. Moore. I suggest you follow protocol and get someone to
clean up."  
Nick Meyer, QED Air's New York Controller was first at the scene.
"OK which of you idiots is responsible for this mess? Never mind, when
was transfer scheduled for?"  
"15:55:05 Eastern Time" said the operator timidly.  
"That means we have..." (looking at watch)  
"... a 12 minute window to clean this up - after that its jail time
for everyone - Where's the ghost right now? What does he know?"  
"The ghost is in a waiting room - he's compliant and suspects
nothing. We should be able to finalize him once I figure out what went
wrong"  
"Keep him there, make sure he's watched. Keep this contained, don't
answer the phone. If we can't finalize by normal means within 8½
minutes, the Executioner will take over. Find out what went wrong and
fix it."  
A medical technician appeared at the door.  
"...you the Executioner?"  
"...Julie Clune - I'm here to administer a lethal injection if that's
what you mean" replied the woman.  
"How long will it take - The whole procedure?" asked Meyer tersely.  
"Half a minute for the Pentothal to take effect, 3 minutes for the
Pavulon. Toxic agent should be instantaneous"  
"Shit! That gives us..." (looking at watch)  
"...6 ½ minutes! Get that damn thing fixed!" Meyer yelled at the
operator.  
'Damn beuracracy!' He thought to himself. If only they could
administer the Anaesthetic right now. QED Air couldn't risk such a
move. Sure - if the finalization process worked, the body would be
completely atomised, there would be no autopsy, no evidence to suggest
they had hedged their bets. But if it didn't work and the autopsy
revealed they hadn't conformed to the Instantiation laws, QED Air
would cease to operate and a lot of people would be facing jail time.

## London, The Millennium Dome.

Aaron Moore had a throbbing migraine. He was finding it difficult to
even scan through the 'Time Out' magazine. The letters and words
appeared jumbled up. Other words and pictures seemed to pop in and out
on top of each other. The magazine itself seemed to change shape in
his hands and he couldn't keep track of what page he was on. He put
the magazine down and tried to take in his surroundings. Apart from
the London edition of 'Time Out' there was nothing in the room to
suggest he was in England. The eye chart looked just like those back
home. There was a color-blindness chart. Color was spelt with a
'u'. There was a medicine cabinet adorned with an elaborate Caduceus
on one wall. Aaron Moore stood up, stretched his legs and arched his
back. The medicine cabinet was unlocked, there was probably
Paracetemol inside.

## New York, JFK Airport.

The operator was having the worst day of his life. This should have
been a routine transfer. At the press of a button, the passenger would
be recreated from a quantum template at their destination, resulting
in two copies of the same person. After arrival, the passenger at the
departure point would be destroyed instantly by atomisation. The whole
process took less than a nanosecond and was supposedly fail-safe. The
existence of two identical human beings was deemed unethical and
unlawful. Genetic cloning had been outlawed after a series of dramatic
misfires by its strongest proponents. The Instantiation Council had
fought an uphill battle to get the Instantiation laws passed. Now it
seemed all that effort and the future of QED Air rested on his
shoulders. He scanned the logs looking for a clue to what went wrong
but found nothing. 

Nick Meyer was pacing up and down the room glaring murderously at the
operator.  
"3 minutes gentlemen...3 minutes" He looked at his watch once
more.  
"I'm going to talk to the ghost...I'll need consent so I better smooth
things over. Miss Clune, I'll need that Pentothal now. If in the
meantime, you fix the finalizer, I have an ear-piece - be discreet!'
with that Nick Meyer took a plastic cup filled with Pentothal and
Orange juice and stormed out of the Transfer booth. Before entering
the waiting room he stopped, took a deep breath, straightened his tie,
looked at his watch one last time and assumed the demeanour of a man
less troubled.

Aaron Moore was rubbing his eyes. The dim light made reading difficult
so he had put the 'New Yorker' magazine back on the coffee table. His
eyes felt sore. Eyes closed, he saw a negative image like having
stared at a bright light for too long. It looked like two intertwined
snakes. He opened his eyes and looked around. The room was bare except
for the chair he was sitting on and the coffee table, but something
was different. There was a man standing in the doorway.

"Nick Meyer ... Pleased to meet you Mr. Moore"

---
## London, The Millennium Dome.

Aaron Moore opened the medicine cabinet. Inside there was gauze,
antiseptic, Paracetemol and an assortment of vials and powders. He
took the vial marked Paracetemol. It was in powder form. He studied
the vial for a moment, trying to estimate how much powder he would
need to take. On closer inspection he saw the skull and crossbones
symbol on the side of the vial. 'Odd' he thought to himself.

## New York, JFK Airport.

"Mr Moore...There was a complication, we apologise sincerely for the
delay. We'll be resuming shortly. I hope we haven't inconvenienced you
too much?" Nick Meyer could be very affable when it suited him. It
suited him now. This was after all a very delicate situation that
required charm. It suited the International council to turn a blind
eye to certain details of how its laws were implemented. Time was of
the essence. The Council had decreed a 15 minute period of grace for
operators to 'finalize' originals. After a transfer the original
forfeited all rights to the human instance created at the
destination. It only made sense that the originals should be quickly
and humanely destroyed.

Nick Meyer placed the plastic cup on the coffee table and shook
hands.  
"How are you feeling? - you look tired"  
"No, I'm fine, eyes are a little sore - that's all"  
Meyer couldn't help but let his gaze drift towards the cup he had just
placed on the table. 'Bad move idiot! What if he tries to drink it
now?' he scolded himself.  
"...shall I turn the lights down ?"  
"No its dark enough in here"  
"You from Chicago? I hear a little bit of Chicago in your accent"
Meyer had to consciously slow down his usual breathless banter.   
"No. South Bend, Indiana"  
"South Bend? I have a niece living there, works in Notre Dame
University, Helen Symons - do you know her?"  
"No, I'm afraid I don't" Aaron Moore seemed distracted, like he was
struggling to follow the conversation. Just then the operator's voice
crackled in Meyer's earpiece. "Mr Meyer, I'm Sorry. We can't fix
it. Miss Clune will join you in one minute" Meyer nodded and smiled at
Aaron Moore longer than necessary. 

"Well Mr. Moore, I think we are about ready to resume - sorry once
again for the delay. Would you like to take a drink?" Meyer offered
the cup.

## London, The Millennium Dome

Aaron Moore measured about a gram of the powder into the palm of his
hand. As he did so, the Doctor entered. 

"Mr. Moore? - What are you doing?" he asked, grabbing the vial.  
"Do you know what this is?"  
"I've got a headache"  
"It's poison! You are holding enough Pentothal to kill you!"  
Aaron Moore squinted to see the label. He had misread Pentothal as
Paracetemol.

## New York, JFK Airport.

"No thanks I'm fine" Aaron Moore wasn't sure if that was the right
thing to say. He had forgotten the question and wasn't even sure who
he was talking to. Meyer felt his own composure slipping. 
"Mr. Moore, you'll have to take this before we resume - It helps
prevent Nausea".  
A feeling of Deja vu overpowered Moore and he felt the urge to
run. Once more he politely declined.  
"Mr. Moore, our insurance wont cover you unless you take this, take it
- you'll feel better when you arrive".
Aaron Moore eyed the cup nervously and looked Meyer in the eye.  
"And what if I don't take it?" he asked with a nervous grin. It was
too late for Meyer to call bluff.  
"Take it! - please!" he said more forcefully than he intended. Just
then Miss Clune entered, her instruments laid out on a tray.  
"Whoops...wrong room" Clune was about to retreat when Meyer called her
back.  
"No. stay Miss Clune, I'll need you in a moment"  
"Whats all this about?" asked Moore wishing he had run when the
impulse first took him. 
"I tried to make this easy" said Meyer as he casually took the cup
from Moore with one hand, placed it carefully on the table, then
quickly brought the other hand to Moore's throat. The force of the
grapple knocked Moore to the floor and Meyer quickly pinned him down,
one hand on his throat. 

"Quick ...the Pentothal!" Meyer yelled at Clune.  
"I'm ...I'm not sure we should..."  
"We have 4 minutes - give me the fucking cup!" yelled Meyer. Clune
handed Meyer the cup and backed away. Meyer held Moore's mouth open
and poured the contents down his throat. Moore struggled like a
maniac, coughed and spluttered and spat a gob of the orange poison
back in Meyer's face, before head-butting him on the chin. It wasn't a
strong blow, but it was enough to momentarily stun Meyer, enough to
get a hand free and punch him in the groin. As quickly as he'd been
knocked down Aaron Moore was back on his feet.

## London, The Millennium Dome

"Now Mr. Moore, I'd like you to run. Run as hard as you can".  
Aaron Moore stepped tentatively onto the thread mill and pressed
'Start'.  
"We need to monitor your heart, do a few more tests and then you're on
your way." the doctor said encouragingly.The pace quickened from a
stroll to a trot, to a gallop in no time.

---
## New York, JFK Airport.

Like a panicked animal Aaron Moore dashed through the marble-floored
corridors wild-eyed, barefoot and wearing a hospital gown. The pursuit
was over as quickly as it had begun. Security stopped him before he
could make it to the Airport lobby. John Peek and Nick Meyer convened
in the briefing theatre. They had a lot to talk about.

"Does he know he's a ghost? I mean, that he has arrived in London?"
asked Peek.  
"I don't know what he knows - We have him, but we're out of time. The
question is what are we going to do with him now?"  
"We can't afford him trying to contact his family, the lawsuit would
finish us. We can't hand him over to the Instantiation Police, our
license would be revoked, and we can't dispose of him by conventional
means without attracting a lot of attention."  
"So what are you suggesting?" asked Meyer still catching his breath.   
"Our Mr. Moore seems like a Reasonable man - an Intelligent man. If we
reason with him, explain his unique situation, the hardship he could
cause himself and his family if they knew..."  
"You think he'll willingly be finalized?"  
"That - Mr. Meyer - is what we are about to find out."  

A dishevelled, handcuffed Aaron Moore was brought into the room by
security. Meyer and Peek were there. The lights were dimmed and a wall
sized screen flickered to life. There on the screen was a balding man
hunched over a sink in front of a mirror, his face half covered in
white foam. He was shaving. The image was fuzzy at first but as it
cleared, John Peek was first to speak.

"Mr. Moore...meet Mr. Moore..."
