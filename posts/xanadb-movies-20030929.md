Combining 'Delicatessen's sense of the grotesque and bizarre with a
playful surrealism, all it's own, 'Belleville Rendezvous' is a
pleasant way to spend just over an hour. The film is animated and in
french (with no subtitles) but theres very little speaking in it
anyway. The animation appears to be computer enhanced in places - the
motion of bicyclists cycling up a steep hill is captured perfectly -
and the characterization is often funny though it'll probably be lost
on your average 12 year old. Some of the shots are breathtaking - the
protagonist, an old club-footed granny and her trusty dog adrift in a
flimsy paddle-boat in the middle of a raging storm - and succeed in
transporting you completely. 

The animators have a skewed sense of proportion which works really
well. The city of belleville is a teaming metropolis with gargatuan
wine-bottle-shaped skyscrapers. Seeing this movie made me wish for an
animated feature length of 'The League of Extraordinary
Gentlemen'. Some of the 1 and 2 page cityscapes in that book would
look great on celluloid.

While far from being a 'masterpiece' of animation, Belleville
Rendezvous is an interesting oddity, best viewed without any
preconceived notions or expectations.  It turns out that this film has
attracted a lot of attention from people keen to highlight the current
divide between the U.S. and France.  It has been called "anti-US" in
theme, and has by turns been labelled "anti-US, pro-France" or just
"pro-france".

It seems odd that a slight animated film should raise the ire of so
many critics keen to intellectualize what is essentially a 'cartoon',
and use terms like 'theme' and 'national identity' to justify spending
80 minutes in a darkened theatre watching cartoons.  The use of the
word 'Theme' gives me hives anyway.  It takes me back to my school
days when I had to discuss the 'Theme' of english curriculum novels
and 'compare and contrast' things which have had zero relevance to my
existence in the 15 years since leaving school.  To those english
essayist reviewers, I think the following quote is apt...
<blockquote> "I have long felt that any reviewer who expresses rage
and loathing for a novel is preposterous.  He or she is like a person
who has put on a full suit of armor and attacked a Hot Fudge Sundae or
a Banana Split." - Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.</blockquote> Like any good
Animation, 'Belleville Rendezvous' is best enjoyed as a visceral
experience.
