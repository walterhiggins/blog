It's not just Apple who use Chinese sweat shops, most big Technology firms use them. What I don't understand is the smugness and sense of moral superiority from the Apple faithful. I have 2 Apple Macbooks an iPad and an iPhone as well as two Thinkpads and a HTC smartphone, most of which were probably made in appalling working conditions in China. 
I don't see it. 
I don't see how Apple is [more right][3] than any other computer manufacturer using suppliers who exploit their workforce.
