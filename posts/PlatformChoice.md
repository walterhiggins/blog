My Platform Choice is a statement of who I am. This is a [link][] to an article corroborating my choice of platform.

This is a pithy closing remark reasserting my platform choice.
Despite recent claims to the contrary, other platform choices have not been so fortuitous.

I note such claims so I can later refute them.
This is another article claiming that other platform choices are better than mine.

Pithy rebuttal.

## Recent Transgression

This is a reasoned argument which downplays the recent 
moral/ethical/legal transgressions by my choice of platform Vendor. In 
it I will assuage your fears that Platform Choice Vendor is really just 
another fallible, exploitative Vendor peddling human misery in pursuit 
of profit. It is important that I soft-pedal Vendor 
transgressions so that Vendor will look favorably on me.
 
Recent studies confirm my choice of platform was indeed the right 
choice. I feel a quiet sense of inner calm and confidence. 
  
This is my Platform Choice, there are many other platform choices but 
this is mine. My Platform Choice is my best friend. It is my life. I 
must master it as I must master my life. My Platform Choice and I are 
the defenders of Platform Choice Vendor. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the 
saviors of my life. So be it, until victory is Platform Choice Vendor's and there is no 
enemy, but peace!
