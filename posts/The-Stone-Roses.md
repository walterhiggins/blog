I came relatively late to The Stone Roses but I fell hard for them
nonetheless. It was September 1990. I was just starting my second year
in college. College was on the other side of the country, a four and a
half hour bus journey - plenty of time to listen and get lost in
music. Which is what I did - blissfully. I'd spent that summer in
halifax sleeping on a friend's floor and looking for work. I had
family in nearby huddersfield and barnsley and stayed with them on one
occasion. 

There was a lot of bad things happening that summer. My mother became
very ill. But I was indestructible. I was 19 years old and just
hitting my stride. Gloriously self-aware and of the time. The Stone
Roses weren't a breath of fresh air, they were a gale force
hurricane. That first album became the soundtrack to a rich inner life
in a way no other album would. It chronicled a year of living
youthfully. It was the first perfect album I had heard. The first
album I fell hard in love with. Every track shimmered and resonated
with meaning. It was at once effortless and masterful. I haven't
listened to the album in a long time, more than a couple of years and
right now I don't have the time or inclination to do so but some day
soon I will. There is so much great stuff on that album. The guitar at
the start of _This is the One_ and knowing as you hear those sparkling
chords that soon the song will segue effortlessly into _I am the
resurrection_ and *that* bass line. 

In the meantime there's this...
