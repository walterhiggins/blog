[Bit Rot by saganism](sounds/05 Bit Rot.mp3)

Bit Rot is another track that was recorded long before the 'Ode to 
Voyager' album started taking shape. It was originally called 'Short 
Term Memory Loss'. It has a kind of trippy, disorientating feel to it. I 
thought it sounded good enough to put on the album so I renamed it 
'Bit-rot' - the closest equivalence a computer might have to memory 
loss. One cause of bit rot is - believe it or not - cosmic rays. Those 
keyring USB thumb drives are particularly susceptible to bit rot by 
cosmic rays. I imagine the golden disc carried by Voyager must be 
subject to bit rot given the billions of miles it's travelled through space.

You can download or buy [Saganism: Ode to Voyager][1].
