<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">...I look at people and I see nothing worth "Like"-ing...</blockquote>
<p>Even my once-weekly visit to facebook feels like Too Much Time On Facebook. I still don't get it. By 'it' I mean the 'Like'-ing of other people's status updates. The 'Like'-ing of pages. Admittedly it's my own fault. There's a lot of overlap between my facebook "friends" and my twitter "friends" - I need to fix that. There are people on Facebook - relatives living abroad, old school &amp; college friends - who I would like to keep in touch with, but their status updates get lost in the deluge of updates, 'Likes' and comments created by all the twitter people (A not so easily-classifiable group; &nbsp;some - friends, some - acquaintances, some - just interesting people).&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two groups (the facebookers and the twitterers) behave very differently. My facebookers post photos, lots of them - family holiday photos etc. My Twitterers on the other hand post lots of small status updates (as they would on twitter) and 'Like' and comment on each others status updates. This means the facebooker's updates can be hard to find amidst the twitterer's. I'm going to have to fix that.</p>
<p>If I 'unfriend' you on facebook, don't take offence - it just means you're not a family relative (as far as I know) or an old school or college buddy.</p>
<p>[update] So it turns out I might not need to 'unfriend' - I can hide foursquare updates in Facebook (which is nice) but I can't hide 'Likes', which I do not like.</p>
