<p>Last week it was Ulrich Schnauss, this week I have mostly been listening to another German composer - Max Richter's The Blue Notebooks. It's classical music with pop sensibilities. One song in particular stands out, 'Vladimir's Blues'. You've probably heard it. If ever there was a tune to lie down and watch stars to, this is it. Achingly beautiful. It's just begging for a Carl Sagan monologue as accompaniment. It manages to be both contemplative and heart-breaking at the same time. Devastating in its simplicity and brevity.</p>
