<p>We've had the same 28" CRT (Cathode Ray Tube for those of you too young to remember) Television since 1998 and it has served us well. In fact it's still in perfect working order which is why I felt a little guilty about finally taking the plunge and getting a new LCD TV. I've been sniffing around LCD TVs long enough to have a pretty good idea of what I was looking for in a new TV - Full HD (1920x1080), a couple of HDMI connections and at least 1 SCART connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was convinced that LED was the way to go - they have better power-saving and picture - so I had my eye on either a 5 or 6 series Samsung LED for somewhere around the &euro;900 mark.</p>
<p>On Monday evening I popped into the local Aldi store on the way home from work and saw these 32" Tevion-branded LCDs for just &euro;359 euro. The list of features was impressive, 4 HDMI ports, 2 SCART ports, USB ! , VGA, Component etc. The TV includes a digital tuner / freeview (which is pretty much useless in Ireland as far as I can tell) and the recording of live TV to a connected USB drive only works with the Digital tuner signal so it won't work with your Sky or Chorus box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I held off on buying the TV there and then because frankly it sounded too good to be true - plus it's an 'Aldi TV' - how good could it be?</p>
<p>Very good as it turns out. I slept on it and decided to buy one the next morning - Aldi offer a money-back guarantee if you're not satisified within the first 30 days of purchase and the TV comes with a 3 year warranty - so it's a relatively risk-free purchase. That evening I setup the TV, connected the chorus/NTL box and plugged in a USB Key with a DVD/FOB folder on it.</p>
<h4>Built-in MPEG playback</h4>
<p>The TV has a built-in MPEG decoder which doesn't automatically know what to do with AUDIO-TS/VIDEO-TS folders the way media players like Iomega's screen-play and Radiosonic's Icy-Box do, but it does play individual .VOB files (which are really just .MPG files) and will automatically play the next .VOB file in order. I also plugged in a large (1TB) hard drive with a lot of DVD backups on it - it recognised the hard drive and allowed me to browse the contents and playback some but not all of the .VOB files. It struggled with some of the .VOBs - the picture looked way too dark and video/audio was out of sync by a couple of seconds when playing back Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. It completely failed to play back other (Higher bit-rate?) .VOBs like Pixar's 'Up'.</p>
<p>Frankly the built-in MPEG decoder just isn't up to the job and while USB connectivity is nice, it's only truly useful if the TV has a decent MPEG decoder which this doesn't. That's a minor niggle though - especially given the price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the long run you're probably better off with a dedicated media player device attached to your TV. Iomega's ScreenPlay HD or<a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/storage/2009/05/28/icy-box-ib-mp309hw-b-hd-media-player-review/1"> RaidSonic's IcyBox</a> are both good Media Players.</p>
<h4>HD Playback</h4>
<p>If you've only ever seen Standard Definition content (i.e. Chorus/NTL) on LCD TVs you might be forgiven for wondering what all of the hullabaloo is about - I certainly did. Part of the reason I held off for so long on buying a HD TV was because I had never actually seen HD content on one. Once I figured that the TV's built-in MPEG decoder wasn't up to the task I connected the IcyBox media player using a HDMI cable (not provided) and with a bit of tweaking on the IcyBox (It had been using RGB and needed to be reconfigured to use HDMI) got the HDMI connection to work. This time I tried playing the same content that had been problematic and it played beautifully. Pixar's 'Up' looked jaw-droppingly gorgeous when played back on the IcyBox in 1080p. This is where this TV comes into it's own. The picture quality really is excellent - colors look vivid but not over-saturated - the screen is bright and vivid and although glossy, it is actually less reflective than our old CRT TV.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Connections</h4>
<p>The TV has an impressive 4 HDMI connections, 1 Component connection (handy for connecting the Wii), VGA connection (For connecting your PC), USB connection (for playback of your media library, and recording of Digital Tuner TV). It also has 2 SCART ports and a handful of others I can't remember. Bottom line - you won't be short of ports if you want to connect your Media Player, Blu-Ray Player, DVD Player, Wii, PS3, Chorus/Sky box and XBox. The connection panel on the back looks a bit unfinished to be honest&nbsp;(a bare metal casing exposed)&nbsp;but you won't be poking around there too much what with all of the ports available.</p>
<h4>Niggles</h4>
<p>None yet other than the poor built-in MPEG playback (which isn't really an issue if you have a dedicated external Media Player device) and the rough-around-the-edges connection panel at the back. It's early days yet though so I'll update as time goes on.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>An excellent 32" LCD TV which may not be at the cutting edge of TV technology but still has great picture quality and connectivity options. You can't go far wrong at that price either.</p>
