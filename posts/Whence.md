# Whence Came You?

Anil Dash asks [how can blogs evolve][ev]? Blogs are too Loosely 
Coupled. They need to be [better connected][1] via HyperLinks but [HyperLinks 
(as originally envisioned) are broken][hl]. Trackbacks were meant to fix 
this. Why aren't we using Trackbacks? 

 * Too difficult to understand/implement. 

 * Requires user education.

Dave Winer's [oblique contribution][ob] to the discussion is also the 
most important and something anyone tasked with evolving the state of 
blogging should take to heart. Our contributions to a discussion, 
however oblique should be acknowledged. How do we get from here to a 
more connected blogging ecosystem? I wish I knew. What I do know is that 
the first three words on Anil's discussion page "Participant Sign In" 
are part of the breakage.
