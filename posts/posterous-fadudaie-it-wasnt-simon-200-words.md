  <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Noel Whelan complained this morning on Pat Kenny about twitter "elites". I submit that the "elites" are the political correspondents who spent the night in a bar with the taoiseach, listening to his funny impressions of Micheal Ó Muircheartaigh.</p>
<p>Twitter doesn't have that access. And twitter doesn't have to protect that access. So twitter doesn't have an "off the record" setting. Twitter is therefore freer to criticise, for good or bad. That criticism can drive mainstream media coverage. And that's why twitter scares politicians.</p></blockquote>
