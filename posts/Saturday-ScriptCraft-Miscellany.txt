# Saturday ScriptCraft Miscellany## 2013/01/12 17:43ScriptCraft might be a tough sell to younger programmers if it's perceived as *just* a class-room / educational tool so I made this short video to demonstrate some of ScriptCraft's destructive power. It really does let you change the game any way you like with a minimum of code.[Exploding Arrows and other Minecraft stuff](http://youtu.be/GZBQ3kuPCDU)> A reprogrammable system is incredibly powerful. Abusing the power is > always possible and it's a point of principle in a reprogrammable system > that people must be able to abuse it.  > -- Nic Ferrier## CategoriesScriptCraft, Minecraft, Javascript
