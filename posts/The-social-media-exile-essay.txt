Exhibit A:
> I was now talking a lot about quitting Facebook, and this for a time 
> became the most interesting thing about me. Fueled by how interesting I 
> now was, I wrote a draft of an essay about writing about why I quit 
> Facebook, which was clever but did not contain any of the things I have 
> already said I didn't write about. Plus, as the editor pointed out, I 
> didn't actually explain why I had quit. I hadn't written about feeling 
> like Facebook was a job. Like I was running on a digital hamster wheel. 
> But a wheel that someone else has rigged up. And a wheel that's actually 
> a turbine that's generating electricity for somebody else. That's how I 
> felt, which is what I should have written.  
> -- [What I Didn't Write About When I Wrote About Quitting Facebook][1]
Exhibit B:
> This is my call: Make it longer. Read more books, essays, poems; write 
> more; watch challenging movies and plays; have lengthy discussions with 
> wise friends; learn an instrument or how to take a quality photograph; 
> go for long walks (or runs or bike rides etc.) and spend time with your 
> own mind without distractions. Spend time with difficult ideas, let them 
> develop in your mind, take the time to articulate them in your own 
> words. Fingerpaint. Whatever! Embrace the long-form in every way 
> possible. We are more than status updates.  
> -- [We Are More Than Status Updates ï¿½ Burning All Illusion][2]
It's not an outright rebellion. That's never going to happen but it 
seems more people are feeling the [call of the wild][3].
