# Replaying GoldenEye
## 2012/01/16 16:13
A couple of days ago I began replaying GoldenEye on the Wii. I had so 
much fun [playing this last year][1] I decided to give it another go. One 
thing that really bugs me 2nd time around are the controls. The Wii 
Remote is just plain frustrating at times. My First-person-shooter 
experience is informed by Quake 2 MP and Quake 3 Arena which I played on 
a PC years ago with a keyboard and mouse. The ability to quickly turn is 
important in a FPS game but the Wii Controller is frustrating. If I want 
to do a quick turn I instictively point the wii remote hard left or 
right but in GoldenEye I get a Red Stop sign every time I do this, 
leaving me cursing at the TV (I was playing this while the kids were 
out). This was really frustrating during one of the few slo-mo scenes in 
GoldenEye where I quick turned to shoot a NPC but the cursor went right 
off screen. I've since tweaked the in-game controller settings to make 
the wii remote more sensitive. It still feels clumsier and less 
responsive than a keyboard-mouse combination from more than 10 years 
ago. 
Parts of GoldenEye are still great fun but I'm disappointed it isn't as 
good as I remembered it. After more than 4 years with the Wii, I'm 
growing increasingly skeptical of the value of motion controllers.
