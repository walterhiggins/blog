When it comes to social networks (and blogging) we're still stuck in a 
client-server mode of thinking when what we need to do is switch to 
peer-to-peer. You can see this client-server pattern repeated 
everywhere. 

 * Server: Blogger , Client: Commenter

 * Server: Facebook, Client: User

A few weeks ago I blogged about how [we need to own our own 
motherships][3] to break this mode of thinking. Dave's decision to [turn 
off comments][5] means he has severed the client-server cord and I think 
in his [Relative Writting][2] post he's hinting at a move towards 
peer-to-peer blogging. I know Peer-to-Peer blogging already exists - 
it's been there since day one but [the connections between blogs are 
tenuous][4], so its potential is still only latent. The World Wide Web 
has always been peer-to-peer in nature; documents with links to other 
documents on the same or other computers. The substrate might be 
client-server but - from a document's point of view - the essential 
nature of the Web is peer-to-peer. The web was once a place where only 
documents lived and documents enjoy peer-to-peer status. Now the web is 
teeming with People, there is no reason why people should not have the 
same status.
 
Me - I'm just an outside observer watching these ideas play out, it 
seems in 2012 the web has suddenly become interesting again.
