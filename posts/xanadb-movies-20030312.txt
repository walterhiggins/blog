The opening scene of 'The Good Thief' takes place in a dilapidated nightclub
somewhere along the cote d'azur. The nightclub is teeming with people and activity. The camera follows
Nick Nolte haphazardly around the confined strobe-lit den. The camera seems distracted by its surroundings,
lingering to soak up the atmosphere after the protagonist has moved out of view. 

Catching up with him again in mid-conversation with a teenage girl -
she is a hooker.  
_Aren't you a little young for that?_ he asks rhetorically.   
_Aren't you a little old for heroin?_ she retorts.  

Nolte's character looks ruefully at the needle he's just been
using.The gendarmes raid the place.  The officer-in-charge (Tchéky
Karyo) tries to arrest Nolte's dealer but ends up being held at
gunpoint by same. Nolte jabs needles into the dealer's arm allowing
the officer to regain control of the situation. All of this happens in
the first 2-3 minutes of the movie. All of the main protagonists are
introduced in this frenetic but unhurried opening scene, teeming with
people, dialogue and events. Stylistically, the rest of the movie
plays out in a similar vein. Each scene is transient, forgetable - as
if aware of this, the camera lingers for a 1-second freeze-frame at
the end of each scene. The effect is like watching a series of
postcards or snapshots of unidentifiable people and places.

Jordan's directorial hand in all of this is feathery light. It makes
the movie seem inconsequential.  This of course is deliberate. Paying
homage to the genre (french crime/heist movie), Jordans stylized
under-direction eschews hollywood constructs such as pivotal scenes
and proper character introductions.  We are thrown into the thick of
things and allowed find our own way. Grounding this whole frothy
affair is Nick Nolte's performance - or lack thereof.  Nolte - in this
movie - has achieved that rare accomplishment of appearing not to act
at all.  This movie should have been titled 'Essence of Nick Nolte'.
The banter between Nolte and the rest of the cast has a lovely lyrical
quality.  In one scene Gerard Darmon (pictured far left) is trying to
convince Nolte to do one last job:

_Darmon:_ ...and you know what the beautiful thing is?  
_Nolte:_ What's the beautiful thing?  

The dialogue is wordy but never for the sake of it. The lines are delivered with effortless aplomb.

'The Good Thief' is a genre movie, and while stylishly played out, it
never moves beyond the realms of it's genre - this is not necessarily
a bad thing. It may be an aimless ride but it's fun while it lasts.
You can't help but feel that Jordan is using this movie as a
workout. It is a directors film.  It is more muscular and has more
flourishes than the pallid 'In Dreams' but you can only wonder what is
he limbering up to? What will his next project be ? I'm guessing it
will be something big.
