<p>I agree. Where are the people who <em>love</em> their Android phones who aren&rsquo;t computer geeks. Non-geek iPhone and BlackBerry lovers are everywhere.</p>

<p>John Gruber wonders where are the non-geek Android phone lovers. Why aren't Android phone owners clogging up the Internet with blog posts and tweets proclaiming their love for their phone? Maybe it's because we have better things to do. Maybe we don't feel the need to constantly defend our choice of phone. Maybe it's because - at the the end of the day - iPhone or Android - it's JUST A PHONE. Ultimately the reason you don't see us is because we move in different circles. Put simply, it's because we're better than you.</p>
<p>p.s. If you talk about your phone in the pub, you are - by definition - a geek. <br />p.p.s. If you think I'm going to get into this stupid iPhone vs. Android argument on its own terms, think again.</p>
