<p>Have any of us caused Google to look at itself differently? No. Not even close (even Bartz hasn't been able to do that).</p>
<p>Plus, he's 26 years old. I'm not as smart or done as much and I'm 45 years old. Heck, add us all together, that's more than 100 years of living more than Zuckerberg has and, yet, we haven't accomplished nearly as much.</p></blockquote>
