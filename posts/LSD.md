By including only those whose jobs involved the hard > sciences (the lack of a single female participant says much about > mid-century career options for women), they sought to examine the > effects of LSD on both visionary and analytical thinking. Such a group > offered an additional bonus: Anything they produced during the study > would be subsequently scrutinized by departmental chairs, zoning boards, > review panels, corporate clients, and the like, thus providing a > real-world, unbiased yardstick for their results.>  > In surveys administered shortly after their LSD-enhanced creativity > sessions, the study volunteers, some of the best and brightest in their > fields, sounded like tripped-out neopagans at a backwoods gathering. > Their minds, they said, had blossomed and contracted with the universe. > They&#146;d beheld irregular but clean geometrical patterns glistening into > infinity, felt a rightness before solutions manifested, and even > shapeshifted into relevant formulas, concepts, and raw materials.>  > But here&#146;s the clincher. > After their 5HT2A neural receptors simmered down, they remained firm: > LSD absolutely had helped them solve their complex, seemingly > intractable problems. And the establishment agreed. The 26 men unleashed > a slew of widely embraced innovations shortly after their LSD > experiences, including a mathematical theorem for NOR gate circuits, a > conceptual model of a photon, a linear electron accelerator > beam-steering device, a new design for the vibratory microtome, a > technical improvement of the magnetic tape recorder, blueprints for a > private residency and an arts-and-crafts shopping plaza, and a space > probe experiment designed to measure solar properties. Fadiman and his > colleagues published these jaw-dropping results and closed shop.  > -- [The Heretic - The Morning News][1][1]: http://www.themorningnews.org/article/the-heretic## CategoriesDrugs, LSD
