<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">It's easy to romanticize Beck as the scruffy wannabe who lived on friends' couches for a year, recording a new song every day on a beat-up four-track; absorbing Harry Smith's <em>Anthology of American Folk Music</em> and old school hip-hop with equal enthusiasm. The aptly titled "Loser", his biggest and most career-defining hit, was recorded in a friend's living room for kicks. His first live performances were on hijacked mics at other peoples' gigs: he'd just step up with a guitar or harmonica between acts and entertain while the often bemused next band set up their drums. On the homemade tapes and scrapped-together compilations that comprised his earliest recorded output, Beck cobbled together all of his influences-- noise, hardcore, country, rap, folk, grunge, R&amp;B;, found sound and classic rock-- and melded it into his own junkyard punk.</blockquote>

<p>Yes it is easy to romanticize. And fun too. <br />When I was younger, I had a bass guitar, amp and an Acoustic guitar. I shopped around looking for a 2nd hand 4 track recorder but they were expensive (well expensive enough that I questioned the need for one). I'm no Beck but I'm pretty sure there's thousands of talented young musical dabblers who have tools a younger Beck could only dream of. At one time in his life, Beck <strong>was writing a new song every day</strong>. Think about that. It's a certainty that most of those songs didn't get past the demo stage but I bet they were a lot of fun to write. Reading that paragraph above, I was reminded of Stephen King's advice to writers to just write. Pick a time of day <span style="font-family: mceinline;"><strong>every day</strong> and just sit and write.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work....So okay - there you are in your room with the shade down and the door  shut and the plug pulled out of the base of the telephone. You've blown  up your TV and committed yourself to a thousand words a day, come hell  or high water. Now comes the big question: What are you going to write  about? And the equally big answer: Anything you damn well want. ... Let's get one thing clear right now, shall we? There is no Idea Dump, no  Story Central, no Island of the Buried Bestsellers; good story ideas  seem to come quite literally from nowhere, sailing at you right out of  the empty sky: two previously unrelated ideas come together and make  something new under the sun. Your job isn't to find these ideas but to  recognize them when they show up.</p>

<p>If you haven't read Stephen King's "On Writing" I command thee to go forth and read it now. It's a great book for anyone with a creative urge (not just for aspiring writers).</p>
<p>I've made it my goal to upload a new track to SoundCloud at least once every week until the end of the year. So far I've uploaded 14 tracks to SoundCloud, I don't even like all of them but every track was enormous fun to make. My current favourite (and most recent) track is Lipstick...</p>
