# On GitHub 

## 2012/04/14 00:02

So I'm over on [GitHub][1] if anyone is interested. What do I plan to 
put up there? Not too sure to be honest. I've posted the source code to 
the markdown helper javascript I use here on this blog. It does basic 
stuff like indenting a block of selected text, quoting and line-wrapping 
- that sort of thing. I also plan to post my beloved TinyTemplate perl 
module. [CPAN][2] doesn't take kindly to projects with the word 'Tiny' 
in them any more. Too bad, I think the world could use less software. 

I've been meaning to update my TinyMake module for a while now - the 
documentation is plain wrong in places. I think GitHub might be a better 
home for my odds and ends. We'll see.
