  <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">In Tron, the hacker was not supposed to be snooping around on a 	network; he was supposed to kill a process. So we went with posix kill 	and also had him pipe ps into grep. I also ended up using emacs eshell 	to make the terminal more l33t. The team was delighted to see my emacs 	performance -- splitting the editor into nested panes and running 	different modes. I was tickled that I got emacs into a block buster 	movie.</blockquote>

<p>That's 2 blockbuster movies I've seen in the last 6 months that Emacs has featured in. Can anyone name the other? Hint: it features more prominently in the other and even gets name-checked.</p></div>
