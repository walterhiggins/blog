> I feel sorry for blogging. How could something so great could just 
> wither on the vine? There are vast prairies of abandoned blogs now. 
> Without any specific decision, there's been a mass migration to social 
> networks, like tribesmen picking up and moving to cities overnight. It's 
> certainly not the worst decision in internet history but maybe it's fair 
> to say that it wasn't given much consideration at the time.
