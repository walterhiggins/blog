# What happened at UC Davis

## 2011/11/20 09:07

I read a couple of tweets yesterday morning about the incident at UC 
Davis university. Normally I wouldn't pay attention. I'm not a political 
tweeter - I've felt burnt out at times at the outrage on Twitter. We Irish have had plenty to feel outraged by over the past couple 
of years. It was a couple of tweets from Simon McGarr which eventually 
piqued my curiousity.

So I watched it. The whole 8 and half minutes. Words like 'seminal', 
'watershed' and 'historic' get bandied about a lot but all apply in this case.

It is a profoundly moving and powerful piece of footage. Something 
happened there and I'm not quite sure what. I was having lunch with my 
son and watched the footage on - of course - my phone. After watching 
it, I tweeted this...

Later on I was reminded of the open source mantra "given enough 
eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" - A succinct way of saying that given 
enough people looking at a program's source code, no defect is so 
difficult that it can't be fixed by someone. The number of cameraphones 
held aloft must surely have been a deciding factor in how the police 
reacted. Given enough eyeballs perhaps all state oppression becomes futile.
