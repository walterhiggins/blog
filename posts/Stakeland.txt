A Zombie post-apocalyptic mumble-core art-house road-movie? You had me at 'Zombie'.
'Stake Land' is a straight-to-dvd movie about a boy and a man struggling to survive in a post-apocalyptic America. If this sounds a little like [The Road][1], that's because it is a little bit like The Road and a few other movies. If while watching a movie you can't help but be reminded of other movies, that's usually not a good sign.
'Stake Land' is the troubled awkward offspring of 'The Road' and [Zombieland][2]. It struggles to find its own identity. Like 'The Road' it strives for gritty realism. Like 'Zombieland', it features zombies and plenty of gory action (but without Zombieland's humour). It seems at pains to declare its Indie cred from the start. It is narrated by the boy (a teenager) in a mumbling - sometimes barely audible - voice, and features plenty of scenes of passengers looking wistfully at passing landscape. It screams "Hey look at me - I'm Independent American Cinema!" Stake Land's art-house pretensions are let down by poor dialogue and too many cliches. At times it aims for the grandeur of [Into the Wild][3] (when they retreat to the wilderness) but falls short. I'm deliberately overlooking the fact the creatures in [Stake Land][5] are zombies - not vampires.
Altogether it's pretty forgettable except for one thing - the closing credits when the name [Kelly McGillis][4] pops up - *I did not expect that* and did not recognize her in the movie.
