# Mixing it Up## 2012/04/03 17:16Who says a blog should have a uniform style throughout?1. [Exhibit A][a]2. [Exhibit B][b]3. [Exhibit C][c]Three different blog posts; Three different style-sheets. The stylesheets are set randomly whenever the blog is updated. I'm kind of fond of the [Jamie Zawinski][jwz]-inspired [hacker.css][css] style but it probably isn't to everyone's taste. Chances are the above 3 examples won't have different styles the next time the blog is rebuilt so browse the archives to see examples of the stylesheets in use. I've been prepping my blogging software for use by my 10 year old daughter, I want to teach her a little about blogging, HTML & CSS so I've depersonalized the software and provided a [default.css][def] stylesheet for use by someone new to my blogging software - it has sensible defaults that emphasize readability, and provides a good starting point for exploring the different aspects of CSS. I've been beavering away on the blogging software late at night, ironing out the kinks to make it easier for her to use.> 10 yr old daughter now has her own domain, SSH and FTP account. Been > walking her through unix basics. They grow up so quickly. mmfff.  > -- [Twitter / @walter](https://twitter.com/walter/status/183858772698083328)She's been blogging away for the past two years on wordpress.com and has become really good at expressing herself and presenting her photos. Moving to her very own domain where she has full control will be a bit of an adjustment - I hope she likes her new online home.[a]: http://walterhiggins.net/blog/InfiniteScrolling[b]: http://walterhiggins.net/blog/WebLand[c]: http://walterhiggins.net/blog/Pretend[jwz]: http://www.jwz.org/blog/[css]: hacker.css[def]: default.css## CategoriesCSS, Web Design
