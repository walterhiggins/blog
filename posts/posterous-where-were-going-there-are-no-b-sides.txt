<p>Someone take this iPad away from me before I do some real damage...</p>
<p><span>I made an EP!<br /></span>It has sides! ( two ). &nbsp;<br />It has cover art! (public domain illustration by NASA-commissioned artist Donald Davis).<br />It's my gateway to fame and riches! (Yay)</p>
<p>One of the above statements may be false. Seriously though, who doesn't love EPs? They're like a mid-morning brunch. A pick-me-up between Singles and Albums for the avaracious music fan. I am that kind of music fan. Being 40 and given the average life expectancy is 80 or something, there's a 50/50 chance I'm older than you so humour me while I eulogise the lost art of Cover art.</p>

&nbsp;I obviously didn't commission this artwork (you have by now listened to the EP and have figured out which of the above statements is false - right?) but it speaks of a faraway more optimistic time of space-faring exploration and flare-waring experimentation. It could have been a cover to any 'Yes' album in the 70s. The Orb neatly recaptured this essence with their early 90's albums. I miss Cover Art. I really do. It had always been a big part of my early music-listening experiences. It's sad to see it reduced to 72x72 pixels.</p>
<p>Did I mention this EP has sides? Two of them in fact. Let me explain what 'sides' are for the younger reader. Back in the day all music media (LPs, CDs, Cassettes - google it) had two sides. At the end of playing the first side (A), the listener would have to walk over to the music playing device and 'turn over' the media by hand to play the second side (B). This usually afforded a pause in the music of a minute or so. Enough time for the listener to pause and digest what they had just heard before playing the rest of the album. For many years, music artists, cogniscant of this 'gap' would craft an album of two sides sometimes each having a different feel. Some albums were written with this knowledge front and center in the minds of the musician. Anyway when I compiled this EP I wanted it to have sides even though it will never live on physical media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the music itself ... It has been a lot of fun making it and as much fun picking cover art and compiling it into an EP. I wish I had an iPad &amp; Garageband when I was younger and had more time on my hands. GarageBand for iPad is a reminder once again that - yes - we are now actually living in the future.</p>
