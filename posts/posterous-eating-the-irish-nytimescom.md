Paul Krugman on the current Irish situation. Krugman has no political 
axe to grind but his analysis of what Fianna Fail have done to this 
country is spot-on. It defies logic that anyone can still support Fianna 
Fail. Me - I will never vote for them again and will make sure my 
children know what this corrupt government have done to this country. 
Sadly - they too will have to bear the burden of Fianna Fail's crimes.
