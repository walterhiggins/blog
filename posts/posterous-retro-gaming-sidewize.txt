Sidewize was the first game I played on the ZX Spectrum that came anywhere close to the thrills of the Arcade. It was a very different time for gamers. Home computers had nowhere near the horsepower, resolution or color palettes of the Arcade machines. That gap would not be closed until the arrival of the&nbsp; Atari ST and Amiga machines in the late 80s. So when I say Sidewize was as close to an Arcade-experience you could get on the cheap and cheerful ZX Spectrum, I'm paying it the highest compliment.<p />As a teenager I played a lot of Arcade games before I eventually saved enough for a second-hand ZX Spectrum. I prefered the multi-player games, Gauntlet and Side-Arms. Gauntlet still holds a special place in my heart and I'll try to write about it some day. Side-Arms was a two player game. A frenetic side-scrolling shoot-em-up featuring two jet-pack clad space-jocks with big guns, it was fast, deadly and had impressive power-ups that provided scatter guns, lasers and other advanced weaponry. It predates R-Type by at least a year or two. Because it was two-player it usually attracted onlookers (as did Gauntlet). Although there were other, better coin-op games that I played and loved more (Gauntlet and Out-Run to name just two), Side-Arms is the distillation of the coin-op gaming experience c. 1987. <p />There were throughout the Speccy's lifetime, many conversions of coin-op games and most of them only served to highlight it's shortcomings compared to the beefier computers powering the coin-op machines. Side-Arms was one such conversion. Compared to the smooth colorful scrolling mayhem on the coin-op, the spectrum conversion's jaggy, low-res, color-bleeding scroll was well ... disappointing.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />I can't really blame the developers for this. The spectrum's color palette was limited to say the least, 7 colors x 2 brightness, and only 2 colors allowed per 8x8 sprite. I envied the Commodore's beefier colors and resolution. Side-Arms conversion to Commodore 64 is supposed to be much better. On the ZX Spectrum, the color limitations were the achilles heel of many coin-op conversions.<p />Which is why SideWize succeeds so brilliantly where the Side-Arms conversion failed. The developers wisely chose to make SideWize a monochrome affair sidestepping the color-bleed problem most Speccy games were prone to. This means they could make the protagonist's sprite a whopping 32x32 pixels in size. Compared to other side-scrolling games on the Speccy, SideWize looked smooth and polished. The minimalist color scheme forced you to focus on the task at hand, blasting wave after wave of baddies.<p />SideWize was difficult. How difficult? In an era of gaming infamous for its brutally unforgiving collision detection combined with pixel-precise demands (the opposite of Postel's Law - be liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you produce), SideWize stood out. It was infuriating. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't enjoy it now except for the nostalgia value. It required no small dose of masochism and hubris from the player. A willingness to give it 'Just one more go'. This was a time when coin-op video games were the pinnacle of gameplay. That same gameplay which was designed to rob you of every last one of your hard-earned 10p coins.</p>
<p>Despite the wide availability of Speccy emulators I'm not tempted to give this game just one more go. I think I prefer the memories of it in my head. The pristine baddies that seemed to shimmer as they slid across the screen. The smooth flicker-free control of the main character, the recoil of your blaster (or did I imagine that?). I'm pretty sure I don't want to play this on an emulator or an actual Speccy. It just wouldn't be the same.</p>
