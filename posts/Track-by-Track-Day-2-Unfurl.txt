[Saganism: Unfurl](sounds/02 Unfurl.mp3) 
Unfurl is the first track I made specifically with the album in mind. I had assembled a couple of tracks from earlier recordings but needed a 2nd track on the album to follow 'The Information'. The Information is about the hopes and aspirations of the Voyager mission while Unfurl is about those first tentative steps in the cold hard vacuum of space as its instruments are powered on and tested for the first time beyond the earth's atmosphere. The _unfurling_ of the title refers to the opening of the high-gain antenna that would be used to send information back to earth. This is one of the shorter tracks on the album. I'm not quite sure it works as a standalone track but I do think it belongs on the album and is keeping with the overall theme.
You can download or buy [Saganism: Ode to Voyager][1].
