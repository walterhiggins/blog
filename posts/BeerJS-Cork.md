# BeerJS Cork

## 2014/01/10 22:20

Prompted by a tweet from local [BackboneJS expert James Sugrue][bjs], I 
suggested a meetup of a few local Javascript people in Cork.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>One thing I'd really like for 2014 is to get Cork tech events buzzing. You can help by listing your events with <a href="https://twitter.com/SDigestCork">@SDigestCork</a></p>&#151; James Sugrue (@sugrue) <a href="https://twitter.com/sugrue/statuses/418403354809597952">January 1, 2014</a></blockquote>

... so BeerJS Cork is happening next Thursday 16th January in the 
Vicarstown Bar on North Main Street, Cork. It's basically a meetup of 
Javascript/Tech/Software people. You can get all the details including 
a map of the venue at <https://javascript-cork.eventbrite.ie>. 
This is going to be pretty informal, no presentations, no whiteboards 
etc. A few people have been asking what to expect so I'll point to <http://pubstandards.ie>...

> Pub Standards is open to everyone. It's loosely aimed at web design & 
> development geeks, but that doesn't mean chitchat need necessarily be 
> work-related. Don't expect structure, don't expect presentations, just 
> relax with like-minded people and a few beers.
>  
> This is the post-conference drink-up, without the conference

... which pretty much sums up what I had in mind when I proposed the 
meetup. If that sounds like it might interest you, then please pop in. 
Vicarstown Bar is a nice recently refurbished pub in the city center. 
They do craft beers and have a beer garden out back.
