> Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of 
> some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were 
> not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand. 
> For all one knows that demon is simply the same instinct that makes a 
> baby squall for attention. And yet it is also true that one can write 
> nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one's own 
> personality.
