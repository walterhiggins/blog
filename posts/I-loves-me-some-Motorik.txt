I loved Motorik twenty years before I knew it was called that.

My first exposure to Motorik was this remix of The Cure's "A Forest" from their excellent "Mixed Up" album...

...And of course I love most stuff by Primal Scream but especially this...

... and of course the song that started it all 40 years ago - Neu! Hallogallo...
