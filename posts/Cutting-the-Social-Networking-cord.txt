# Cutting the Social Networking Cord
## 2011/09/25 22:11
For some time I've had a love-hate relationship with [Twitter][tw]. As
in I love twitter but hate myself for loving it. Twitter is to my mind
the only social networking site worth a damn. This will surprise the
small number of people who heard me bitch about it repeatedly through
2007 and 2008. I've been known to crow about how superior Jaiku was
but that ship has sailed. Almost 5 years on, Twitter is still one of
the few websites I check on at least a weekly basis.
Which is more than can be said for facebook. For the longest time I
thought I was disappointed with facebook. I wasn't. I was disappointed
with myself for giving facebook as much time as I did. This isn't some
aspergerian rant against social networks. I get Facebook. I really
do. It is a wonderful way to stay in touch with people you otherwise
wouldn't see on a regular basis. I also have huge admiration for Mark
Zuckerberg. The boy is a genius - no question about it. I was
convinced of Facebook and Zuckerberg's genius when I first played with
the Facebook API in 2007. Facebook totally deserve their success. 
But facebook isn't for me. It's time I put my trust back in my own
resources and my own ability to bootstrap an online presence for
myself. Facebook is the suburban sprawl of the Internet. It's a
neighbourly place where you can set up home without having to know or
care about RSS or Atom formats. But I want more control. I want to
break out from under the ubiquitous facebook bluebar (observant
readers will note the irony of using steelblue as my own banner color)
and experiment again. 
I want to own completely the content I create on the web. I want to
have a say in whether or not that content is accompanied by banner
ads, widgets, like buttons etc. I'm also of the generation that is
slightly creeped out by the thought that Facebook is constantly
watching our online activity so it can serve us better ads. I don't
want to feel like a battery, powering some gargantuan omniscient
marketing machine.
Most of all I want to write, and none of the tools that let me write
the way I like, exist on the web today. The only writing tool worth a
damn is Emacs. I just can't bring myself to use anything
else. [Org-Mode][om] has completely spoilt me. I use it all the time
now. If you are in the business of putting thoughts to paper/screen,
you need to try org-mode. I have a bad case of [plain-text
religion][ptr]. The document I'm writing right now is [a combination
of org-mode and markdown text][self]. And honestly, only an idiot
would commit their thoughts to any form other than
[plain-text][pt]. This new blog is a work in progress but I'm pretty
sure I'm going to enjoy bootstrapping it. Tweaking the snippets of
perl and lisp to get it just right (It's 70% there as far as I'm
concerned). I'd be lying if I said the tools don't have their own
allure. I'm smitten by the expressive power of simple tools like perl
and lisp. When combined with simple text, that's a potent mix.
This isn't an exhortation to others to quit facebook and set up their
own self-hosted blogs. Facebook is the perfect solution for most
people. Not everyone has the time, inclination or resources to create
their own personal publishing system from scratch. I have the
resources and where-with-all to do this so I really have no business
being on Facebook. That's what I mean when I say I'm disappointed in
myself. Facebook, and Twitter are forgetting machines. I want to put
my thoughts where *I* can at least recall them later. This is an itch
I've been meaning to scratch for a long time. It isn't the first
time. I've done this before - between 2002 and 2005. But this time it
will be different. This time I'm older and more disciplined. It's less
about the tools and more about the words.
So to Facebook. I can't see myself using it much any time soon. I'll
give it another few months but will probably close the account by the
end of the year. I've been spending less time on Twitter too but that
cord will be harder to cut. I don't think I can do it. It's nice to
have my firstname as my twitter handle but it does have its downside -
most of the people talking to @walter are talking to other walter's
with more interesting lives than mine. I'll keep my twitter account
open. I may even use it as a comment proxy. I've no plans to add
comments to this weblog ever. If something I've written prompts you to
write, then write on your own blog and link, or if it's pithy and
witty, send me a tweet. 
It was Google+ that put me over the edge. I haven't used Facebook or
Twitter much since Google+ came out. But guess what - I haven't been
using Google+ either. Google+ was the straw that broke the camel's
back. It made me realise I don't want another online social network in my
life and maybe I don't have the time or inclination for existing
social networks either. I plan to eventually port my blog posts from
posterous.com, which by the way is a fantastic blogging service -
I can't recommend it highly enough - but I want to write using my own
tools. Flickr too. I need to export my few photos and store them here
on walterhiggins.net - that's going to be fun. I have no plans to
close my pinboard.in account - The Delicious and later Pinboard
bookmarking services are keepers, they are remembering machines and
have become an artificial extension to my brain. I don't think I could
live without them[1].
So that's it. Facebook is for the chop. Eventually Flickr and
Posterous (which is great if you're not a hardcore nerd) will follow
suit. It's going to be quiet for some time, but maybe some peace and
quiet will be good. It might help me become a better thinker and
writer. I'll still be hanging out on twitter occasionally, just not as
much as I used to. 
 [1] I could, but I'd be even more ditzy than I already am.
