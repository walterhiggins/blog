# TechCrunch's Downward Spiral

## 2012/01/30 17:47

I stopped reading TechCrunch a couple of months ago (Around the time 
Arrington left but the rot had set in long before then). I hadn't 
visited the website until today when Tadhg Kelly tweeted this link...

The TechCrunch story about the emergence of the content creation class 
is - paradoxically - content-free. There is *nothing* in this story that 
is news to anyone who has ever been on the internet.

It goes on like this for several paragraphs, never making a point or offering any insight.

> Content creators have enjoyed advantages over content consumers since

No shit Sherlock.

I did not know that. Also - "There is tons" ??? Leaving aside the 
grammatical errors, the sole purpose of this TechCrunch story is to 
justify its own existence and hide its own vapidity by pointing at 
Youtube and other equally vapid sites. TechCrunch used to be good when 
it started out. It used to have a voice. Now it's trying to 
out-mashable [mashable][2] which is just sad and pointless. So long 
TechCrunch. I can't say I've missed you at all these past few months.
P.S. I'm a little disappointed in Tadhg (aka [@tiedtiger][3]) for linking 
to such a content-free story. [Tadhg's own website][4] is full of 
interesting stories and insights.
