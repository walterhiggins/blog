A great article about recently deceased Dennis Ritchie, inventor of Unix 
and the C Programming language...
> Unix was not even given a name for more than a year after it was first 
> invented. So much of what they did was done, initially, for themselves 
> alone, sometimes for sheer amusement, and yet it has had a lasting 
> legacy in the world outside. How did this happen, and what lessons 
> follow for today's programmers?
> 
> To answer this question, it is necessary, though difficult, to recall 
> just how comparatively primitive the state of computing was 30 years 
> ago. The first version of Unix was written by Dr Thompson for the PDP-7, 
> a computer made by the Digital Equipment Corporation, which cost a mere 
> $72,000, and came with eight kilobytes of memory, and a hard disk a bit 
> smaller than a megabyte. By contrast, a desktop computer today typically 
> costs a hundred times less, has roughly 64,000 times as much memory and 
> a hard disk 40,000 times as big.

> That any software, albeit with many revisions and modifications, could 
> have survived such changes and still be a core technology today is 
> nothing short of astonishing.
