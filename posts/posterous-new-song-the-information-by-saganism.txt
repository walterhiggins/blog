At more than 10 Billion miles, it is the most distant man-made object from earth. It carries a gold disc with information about Earth should it ever encounter alien life.</p>
<p>This is the ever-eloquent Carl Sagan talking about that gold disc...</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>The spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced space-faring civilizations in interstellar space. But the launching of this "Message in a bottle" into the cosmic 'ocean' says something very hopeful about life on this planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This track was made using GarageBand for iPad. Samples are from the NASA's <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/audio/jpl-voyager-20070820.html">Voyager multimedia archive</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
