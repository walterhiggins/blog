Some blogs are listed in multiple categories, however a blog can only be moved forward into one category. Shortlistees have until Friday at 3pm to choose the category you want it to remain in or it will be done for you.</blockquote>

<p>Come Saturday 27th March, my lovely wife and I will be in Galway at the Irish Blog Awards. This will be the 3rd IBA we've been to. Last year's awards ceremony in Cork was a blast. Really looking forward to this year's (Any excuse for a night out in Galway).</p></div>
