# Apple - Sweating the Details

## 2012/03/08 15:14

A slip in Apple's slavish attention to detail? As we're often reminded, 
Apple are so successful because they sweat the details. It seems odd 
they would overlook giving credit to the *volunteers* who now provide 
Apple's map data.

A correction must surely be forthcoming. Not even Apple would be so bold 
as to stiff a volunteer organization.
