One of these logos took many man months of effort and probably cost a 
couple of hundred thousand dollars. The other was cobbled together one 
morning in a garden shed 6 years ago.

I'm sure people with an eye for such things are dismayed at the

but - come on! - is the qualitative difference between the two really 
worth whatever it cost Microsoft?
