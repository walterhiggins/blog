The language people use tells us a lot. Take Ahearne's closing quote ...
> "It's a large fire, but not one that exceeds suppression capabilities"
... He could have simply said ... 
> "It's a large fire, but we can put it out."
... or ...
> "It's a large fire, but one we can extinguish"
... Ahearne's choice of words indicates someone who is unfamiliar with 
telling the truth. Not just that, his choice of words reveals a man 
unsure of his own intellect. Ahearne is dangerous because he has the ear 
of current finance minister Brian Lenihan. With sweet obfuscated 
nothings like this being whispered in Leni's ear, is it any wonder the 
country is in the state it's in?
