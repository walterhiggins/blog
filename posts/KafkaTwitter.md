# The Man Who Disappeared (from Twitter)## 2012/03/05 12:04> Twitter has automated systems that find and remove multiple> automated spam accounts in bulk. Unfortunately, it looks like your> account got caught up in one of these spam groups by mistake.  > -- [Email from Twitter][1]I was temporarily suspended from Twitter because the software systemswhich automatically detect and suspend [spam][] accounts mistook [mytwitterings][2] for spam. This misdiagnosis by the almighty algorithms hastriggered in me a [Kafkaesque][] existential crisis. Am I Man or Spam?Where does the Man end and the Spam begin? When did this metamorphosisbegin? How long have I been the unwitting host to this spam-spewingparasite? Our presence in this online world is governed not by bureaucrats but by cold impassive algorithms. Tweet carefully fellow traveler lest you too fall foul of the impregnable logic of the Ministry of Spam Detection. [spam]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic)[Kafkaesque]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka[1]: SuspendedTwitterAccount.html[2]: http://twitter.com/walter## CategoriesTwitter, Kafka, Distopia, Spam
