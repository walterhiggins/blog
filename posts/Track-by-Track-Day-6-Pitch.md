# Track by Track. Day 6: Pitch

[Saganism: Ode to Voyager, Pitch](sounds/06 Pitch.mp3)
This is the last track on side 1. It was originally part of a trio 
called Roll, Pitch and Yaw. Only Pitch and Yaw made it onto the album. 
The song consists of an arpeggiated piano and some synths. I had to run 
this through Audicity to achieve the fade out. GarageBand for iPad 
doesn't do fades.

This page is using HTML5's `<audio />` tag to present music. This won't 
work on IE8 (you can download it instead) and is completely broken in 
Firefox because Firefox haven't licensed the MP3 codec but don't have 
the good grace to degrade to a download link (which is at least what you 
see in IE8). This is one of those rare cases where Internet Explorer 
does the right thing while Firefox just sits there dumbfounded because 
it doesn't have the codec and doesn't understand graceful degradation 
(in this case I offer the mp3 as a download link).
Internet Explorer - 1 : Firefox -  0

You can download or buy [Saganism: Ode to Voyager][1].
