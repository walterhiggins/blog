A good piece by Om Malik on Google's misdirected energies...

> And yet, I cannot get over what seems to me a tone-deaf approach by

> it fails to think about people as people, instead it treats them as an 
> academic or an engineering problem. Instead of trying to understand the 
> needs of actual people, they emerge with an elegant technological solution.

> It is not just this one time. Google+, their social network, is a fail 
> because it fundamentally isn't social or about people - it is an effort 
> to solve Google's need for social data for better advertising using 
> machines. Similarly, Google Glasses are a cringe-worthy assault to the 
> social interactions of normals, but because a certain subset of Googlers 
> - including co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page - have a cyborg 
> fetish, it is okay to make that design.&nbsp;It is frustrating for me to keep

> those resources could be deployed more effectively and have a much more 
> positive impact, more quickly. And to do that, the company needs to 
> learn to be human and develop compassion for human condition.
