I love that line: _Space is disease and danger wrapped in darkness and 
silence._ When I was a kid I wanted (like most kids) to be an astronaut. 
The health risks of any long-term space mission are too high. Even a 
successful manned mission to mars would be fraught with long-term health 
risks.

This is one of the first tracks I recorded using GarageBand for iPad. 
It's a sequence of choppy power-chords that become more frequent, 
leading to an onslaught of distorted guitar in the middle. This is 
definitely the noisiest track on the album - a bit of a departure from 
the first 3. For full effect, turn the volume up.

You can download or buy [Saganism: Ode to Voyager][3].
