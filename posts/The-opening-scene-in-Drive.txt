# The opening scene in 'Drive'

## 2011/10/19 12:22

The first 10 minutes of [Drive][1] are the most edge-of-your-seat tense 
moments of cinema in a long time. Ryan Gosling's 'Driver' is a getaway 
driver who has just picked up his latest clients - a pair of jewelery 
store burglars. No words are exchanged between the driver and his back 
seat passengers. In fact the only dialogue heard during the whole sequence 
is the crackle of police-car cross-talk as the police home in on their 
suspect. The scene is a nerve-wracking game of cat and mouse between the 
preternaturally cool and collected Driver and the police cars. There are 
no explosions, no cars flipping over and only minimal reckless driving 
but it is riveting from start to finish. A triumph of less-is-more 
film-making. I wanted that scene to play out for as long as possible. 

Ryan Gosling's Driver betrays no emotion or anxiety yet there is never a 
moment when it is certain he will get away. One of the most memorable 
scenes in recent cinema.
