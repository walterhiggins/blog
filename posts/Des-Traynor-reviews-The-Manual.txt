That phrase '*Timeless open-minded content*' jumped out at me. I can't 
find any other instance of it on the web. Beautifully put. It strikes me 
that if you're writing for the web and you find yourself writing 
HTML/XHTML code then you're doing it wrong. This is true even if you're 
using one of those fancy WYSIWYG editors. If what you've written is only 
human readable in rendered form and only editable using a specific 
WYSIWYG editor then your content isn't timeless. I've learned this the 
hard way having spent time porting some old blog posts from 2002 
onwards. I wrote short stories which had `<p>` and `</p>` tags in them. 
_What was I thinking?_
There are some 200 blog posts from my [posterous era][3] that I will 
most likely never port. They're all here on this blog but the content 
isn't readable in source form. It's HTML not markdown and I don't have 
the time or inclination to backport them to Markdown form. I'm older and 
hopefully wiser now and just a little bit anal about how I will write on 
the web from now on. It's become important to me that the text I write 
should at least be [readable in its source form][2]. That source form is 
not HTML but markdown. Markdown is by no means timeless but it is a 
*huge* improvement on HTML, XHTML or whatever the next evolved markup 
will be. A large portion of my early blogging era (2002 - 2005) was 
spent futzing with HTML and CSS. It was fun and a learning experience 
but I ignored the ugly truth that no matter what the content looked like 
to the end user, under the hood it was an ugly mess of words and HTML 
tags.
Nowadays I really care about how my content looks under the hood, 
because these things matter. Blog platforms change. You should be able 
to port your blog content from one blogging platform to another because 
a blog is for life, not just until the blogging service gets flipped to 
a Big-Co. I'm proud to say that under the hood, I'm using Markdown so 
that the content you see rendered in HTML is still readable in source 
form. That's why I put a link to the [Plain text source][2] on every 
page. As to whether the content of this blog is open-minded, I leave to 
you to decide but I do hope it will prove to be timeless.
