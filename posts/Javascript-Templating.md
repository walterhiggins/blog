# Javascript Templating
## 2012/08/26 13:34

I've moved the SXOOP.template [javascript templating library][gh] to 
github. That's probably the best home for it. This code is old by 
internet standards ( 2006 ) but it holds up quite well I think. In 2006 
[I knew Javascript Templating was going to be big][1]. LinkedIn moved 
all their templating from server-side to the client recently and 
[blogged about the experience][2] in a series of posts which are well 
worth reading.
