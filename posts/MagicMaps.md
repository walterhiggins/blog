# Magic Maps## 2012/09/29 07:01> The more our customers use our Maps the better it will get  > -- [Apple - A letter from Tim Cook on Maps][tc]Someone explain to me how this works. Is it like WikiPedia where the resource is improved by crowd-sourced editors? I'm guessing there must be *some* work required - good old-fashioned software development and quality assurance at the very least - not to mention a huge glob of data gathering effort. If, at the end of the day, it's Apple - not its customers - that needs to get its shit together, then that statement by Tim Cook looks disingenuous. It implies Apple's Maps App will improve magically, simply through use over time, freed from the normal baggage (and time-scale) of Quality Assurance, Bug Triage and Bug-Fixing effort. Sadly I don't actually think such a process exists. I do however expect to see more company press releases that use similar phrasing...> The more our customers use our {insert-shoddy-hastily-released-product-here} the better it will get... if only that were true.[tc]: http://www.apple.com/letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps/## CategoriesApple
