In the list above, two titles really stand out; Tomb Raider and 
Goldeneye (for different reasons).

Tomb Raider was the first game that made me jump. That moment when 
wolves leap on you from out of nowhere - still gives me tingles. I 
watched Ursula play and experience the same jolt. From that moment both 
of us were hooked on Tomb Raider. We each put a lot of hours into 
playing Tomb Raider.

Goldeneye is the most recent game I've played that held any sway over 
me. It's also one of the few games I've completed. It's a first-person 
shooter with some stealthy aspects on a platform not strong on 
first-person shooters. I've played other fps games on the wii (Call of 
Duty: Black Ops) but Goldeneye is different - I can't quite put my 
finger on it - it seems to have more heft than other titles. I haven't 
played it through since first completing it earlier this year but I've 
been hankering to play it again recently - just to relive the experience.
A list of games I've played recently that I do not love...

1. Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword 
2. Monster Hunter Tri 
3. Any game on the iOS platform

Both Zelda and MH3 are grind-work, composed of many fetch quests, with 
too much clunky dialog and busywork. This seems to be the apparatus upon 
which such games are built so criticizing them for this is akin to 
criticizing R-Type for being a 2D side-scrolling shooter. Ardent fans of 
Zelda and MH3 will say I'm missing the point. They seem to love these 
games as much for their apparatus as their game-play. For me, the 
apparatus gets in the way. While playing these games I'm thinking about 
how they could be better (90% less dialog in Zelda would be a start) and 
that's not good. Zelda goes a long way towards being great but somehow 
doesn't take hold. The dialog and motion controls are its biggest sins. 
Mastery of the use of sword and shield in battle is pretty much 
impossible given the still imprecise nature of Wii's motion plus 
controller and this is a major sticking point for Zelda: Skyward Sword. 
It's enough to drive me into the arms of the Classic Controller which is 
what I use when playing Monster Hunter Tri. MH3's sins are less easy to 
pin down given I've played it for only a handful of hours.
As for iOS games - while I've played Osmos, Angry Birds, and dozens of 
other games on my iPad - none have captured my attention the way Goldeneye 
and Tomb Raider have.

I've also been thinking about what makes a game great - what are the 
elusive qualities that make a game take hold of you? I bet many minds 
smarter and more industrious than mine have been pondering the same 
question (see list of gaming blogs below). As much as I loved Goldeneye 
and Tomb Raider, I can't quite explain *why* I love these games and not others.
