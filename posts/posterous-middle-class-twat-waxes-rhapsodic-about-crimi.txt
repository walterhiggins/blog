  <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>In Ballymun, Mr. McDonnell found a sense of community he thought <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/ireland/index.html">Ireland</a> had lost as it rose to its brief moment as the economically formidable Celtic Tiger. Shots of boys in hoodies, track suits and sneakers spotlighted how visual codes serve as markers of an almost tribal identity, and a deep brotherhood.</p>
<p>"I felt that one of the consequences of the huge changes brought about by the Celtic Tiger was a loss of some of the things that defined us as Irish," he said. "One of these things was our sense of community spirit, that notion that we were all in it together."</p></blockquote>
