# Now What?## 2012/08/18 09:39I signed up to App.Net; a $50/yr twitter clone that promises to respect developers and customers and not treat its users as eyeballs to be fed advertising. I get the impression that some of its [early adopters][1] have unrealistic expectations about what App.Net is and what it will become.![Now What?][2] There is a sense among some early adopters that App.Net is a life-raft - an escape from the ghetto that Twitter has become. It's a paid service - that's all. I paid for a couple of years membership of [Motley Fool][4] 10 years ago - it wasn't rainbows and unicorns - just a useful forum that happened to be gated.  That $50 is a recurring fee so I'll see how things pan out this year. I've pledged my money but not my allegiance to App.Net . Right now though, it's interesting that enough people have put their money where their mouth is and signed up. In 2008 I would have paid for Twitter but they went a different way and continue to make [bone-headed moves][3]. I'm [walter][5] on App.net. [1]: https://alpha.app.net/patphelan/post/21260[2]: images/findingnemo-now-what.jpg[3]: https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-guidelines[4]: http://fool.com[5]: http://alpha.app.net/walter## CategoriesSocial Media Exile Essay, App.Net
