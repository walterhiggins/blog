# Cool URLs## 2012/02/29 19:23This is Tim Berners Lee on what makes a cool URL and what you should leave out...> File name extension. This is a very common one. "cgi", even ".html" is > something which will change. You may not be using HTML for that page in > 20 years time, but you might want today's links to it to still be valid.  > -- [Hypertext Style: Cool URIs don't change.][1][1]: http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.htmlI was searching for how to remove the filename extension and came across a couple of threads which suggested using mod_rewrite. I like to pretend `mod_rewrite` doesn't exist. It's not that I'm not familiar with it - I am - I just don't like to rely on it, it feels a little too much like magic. After a bit more digging I found [MultiViews][] so now this and other URLs on the blog can be accessed without the .html suffix. Which is pretty [Cool][]![MultiViews]: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#options[Cool]: Cool-URLs## CategoriesThe Internet, URLs
