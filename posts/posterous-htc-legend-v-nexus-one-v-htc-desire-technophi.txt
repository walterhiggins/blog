  <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>All three can, of course, download a host of applications from the Android Marketplace - which, unfortunately, is where Android still falls down. The sooner Google - or perhaps one of the mobile phone operators - realises that a third party arbiter of applications really is needed, the better. Having to hunt through countless pages of reviews (which divide neatly into obvious fan boy who probably had a hand in writing the app, creator of rival app slagging it off and plugging their product, and nutter out on day release who just wandered into a cyber cafe) in order to judge whether an app is useful or might actually be malware designed to steal all your information, is only going to appeal to a small minority of users.</p><p>Android's marketplace is based on Darwinian evolutionary principles coupled with the wisdom of crowds, which is great if you only ever want early adopters to use your devices, but Google wants Android to challenge Apple's dominance in apps. It will never manage that unless the Marketplace becomes as "professional" as iTunes. Like the fact that you need customer service staff when you start selling hardware, Google has to realise that when you start offering goods through a central marketplace, someone has to carry the can for their quality. The "crowd" won't do.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well said. The AndroidMarket is the Wild West - it needs a few sheriffs to clean it up.</p></div>
