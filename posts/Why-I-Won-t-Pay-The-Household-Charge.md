# Why I Won't Pay The Household Charge
## 2012/03/31 07:50

It's simple. I won't pay a new tax while existing tax is being 
squandered propping up [Zombie banks][1]. The case for the Household Charge 
is that it will be used to maintain local amenities. This is what we 
*already* pay tax for. I'm a working citizen with a family to support. 
It's my civic duty to oppose this unfair Tax. I foolishly believed Enda 
Kenny when he said that "No another red cent" would be paid to Anglo 
Irish Bank. Not only has he continued to hand over billions of Tax Payer 
euros, he has paid unsecured bond-holders too. Everyone has a breaking 
point and this is mine. I have to draw the line somewhere. I will not 
pay the household tax while tens of billions are being paid to failed 
banks. As a citizen it's my duty to take a stand and not cave in to 
every demand by the government we elected. 

Citizenship doesn't begin and end at the polling booth. The government 
would like it to be that way but that's not the way it is.
