# Paul Higgins 1939 - 2015## 2015/08/06 19:56I was 20 minutes into the 3 hour drive to Dublin, just outside Watergrasshill on the M8 when I got the call from the nursing home. It was Janet, the head nurse:    Hi Walter, are you driving right now?    Yes.    Can you pull over?I pulled in to the hard shoulder and braced for the news. I knew his health was failing, I'd been up to see him with my kids just days previously. He had seemed in better health than I expected, he asked the kids about school.    It's bad news I'm afraid. He's just passed away. I noted the time, it was 11:10 am on an overcast sunday morning. The motorway sign said I was 1 KM from Watergrasshill. He passed away peacefully in his sleep. The nursing home nurses were present by his bed. I was 1 kilometer from watergrasshill, 2 hours and 40 minutes away when it happened.-----------He was born on September 1st 1939 in Dublin. He grew up in Crumlin, the youngest of 8 - "the nipper". This is a picture of him on a motorbike taken on Saul Road. He was 12 years old. He and my son Sean look uncannily alike.![Dad on Bike, Saul Road, 1951](images/dad-on-bike-medium.png)I had never seen that picture before until yesterday, the day I buried Dad. I love that picture because it surprised me and in doing so reminded me of what I'll miss most about him - he was full of surprises.The day after a funeral is probably the roughest. I woke up this morning with the distinct feeling that something of me had been buried too. I feel lessened.One good thing that comes of funerals is the meeting of the wider family. It was great. They are the best. We should meet more often.This is a picture of my Dad taken at our wedding 15 years ago. He was 60 years old and still in rude health and full of mischief.![Dad aged 60](images/dad.jpg)He doted on his grandkids Kate and Sean - Always sent them cards and gifts on their birthdays and at Christmas. They took the news hard.He was a dad, a brother, a husband and a doting grandfather. He'll be missed by us all.   ## CategoriesFamily
