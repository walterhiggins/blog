# Goodbye Python

Ian Bicking on giving up Python...

> It&#146;s oddly common to see people talk about how a programmer can pick up 
> something new in the matter of a few days or months. To find programmers 
> that consider all that knowledge transferable (for instance). I don&#146;t 
> know what to make of it &#151; my less forgiving self thinks these people 
> have never known what real mastery is. I don&#146;t think it takes another 
> 10,000 hours to get mastery in a new language and environment&#133; but it 
> definitely takes some thousands of hours, some years of hard work. I 
> only now feel like I&#146;m getting&nbsp;close.

> Maybe it&#146;s my perspective on what mastery is. Deciding to do something 
> and then doing it is good. It is not mastery. You have to pick the right 
> problem to solve. You have to pick the right way to solve it. You need 
> to know when to revise that plan, and understand the constraints that 
> inform that revision. You need both large scale and small scale 
> intuitions. And you need to be good enough at all the details of 
> programming in that environment that you don&#146;t get overwhelmed with the 
> &#147;easy&#148; stuff, so you have mental energy to spare on the big stuff. The 
> jump from Python to Javascript isn&#146;t that big, the languages have a very 
> similar shape. And the browser was already the environment focused on. 
> And yet redeveloping my intuition for this new environment has taken&nbsp;time.
