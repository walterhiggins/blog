Ian Bicking on giving up Python...

> It's oddly common to see people talk about how a programmer can pick up

> 10,000 hours to get mastery in a new language and environment&#133; but it 
> definitely takes some thousands of hours, some years of hard work. I

> inform that revision. You need both large scale and small scale 
> intuitions. And you need to be good enough at all the details of 
> programming in that environment that you don't get overwhelmed with the 
> "easy" stuff, so you have mental energy to spare on the big stuff. The 
> jump from Python to Javascript isn't that big, the languages have a very 
> similar shape. And the browser was already the environment focused on. 
> And yet redeveloping my intuition for this new environment has taken&nbsp;time.
