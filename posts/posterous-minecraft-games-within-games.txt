More than one year on and Minecraft still delights. This game is 
something really special. Playing multi-player with the kids has 
revealed new depths of fun / imagination.

Playing hide-and-seek in The Moonlit Maze.
All of these games were created within the game. The Moonlit maze is my 
creation, all other games were made up by the kids.
