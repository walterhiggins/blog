# Tintin's Adventures

Just back from watching [Tin Tin's adventures][1] with the kids. My biggest fear was that the uncanny-valley CGI that makes [Polar Express][2] so un-watchable would creep out my 5 year old son. Thankfully, that particular type of animation has come a long way in the 7 years since Polar Express. Tin Tin was very good. I think I probably enjoyed it more than the kids.
