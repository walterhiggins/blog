A young man - a computer science graduate - posted this question on the Internet.

[Do Lego Bricks Float?](http://bricks.stackexchange.com/questions/78/do-lego-bricks-float)

It is a question any inquiring young child could ask themselves and answer within minutes, but a 24 year old with a computer science degree has trouble answering and so is impelled to ask others. Judging by the earnest replies (presumably from fellow 3rd-level-educated adults), no one else sees this question as the desperate cry for attention it really is.
