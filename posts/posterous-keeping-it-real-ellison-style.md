  <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Ellison says he learned that Sun's pony-tailed chief executive, Jonathan Schwartz, ignored problems as they escalated, made poor strategic decisions and spent too much time working on his blog, which Sun translated into 11 languages.</p><span></span><p>"The underlying engineering teams are so good, but the direction they got was so astonishingly bad that even they couldn't succeed," said Ellison. "Really great blogs do not take the place of great microprocessors. Great blogs do not replace great software. Lots and lots of blogs does not replace lots and lots of sales."</p><span></span><p>Schwartz declined comment as did Sun co-founder and former Chairman Scott McNealy.</p></blockquote>
