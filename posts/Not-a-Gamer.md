# Not a Gamer

## 2011/11/25 16:35

I recently refered to myself as a 'Gamer' on twitter. This probably isn't true.
I mean, I like playing video games but not so much so that I could call 
myself a gamer. I rarely finish games. I did complete Goldeneye on the 
Wii and loved almost every minute of it. Playing Goldeneye over the 
course of a couple of weeks reminded me of the immersion I felt when 
watching all of The Wire over a similar span of time. It was a feeling 
that this was something special, a once-off event that probably wouldn't 
be repeated for any other Game/TV Show. I loved GoldenEye and have 
recently been hankering to play through it again but then I remember 
parts of the game that weren't so much fun - the brutal latter stages of 
The Jungle level where I was killed over and over again but kept going 
back for more. Or the level where you defend Natalia against an 
onslaught of baddies while the level itself becomes engulfed in flames. 
I can't tell you how long I spent trying to get past that point. It was 
painful. 

And that's my problem. As fun as games like Goldeneye can be at the 
time, looking back there are parts of the game that were just 
frustrating and I have no desire to revisit. 
Although I bought the latest Zelda game just a week ago and haven't yet 
played it, I'm already having buyer's regret. This is what 
[InsultSwordfighting][2] has to say about the first few hours playing Zelda...

Six to ten hours to get to the good stuff. Uh oh. I've never played a 
Zelda game but thinking about it now, I have played [Okami][3] and Final 
Fantasy VII - both of which are highly regarded and often likened to 
Zelda but which I found boring and repetitive. Turn-based combat in a 
video game? - Please. I have major problems with Okami. Yes it looks 
gorgeous but the combat is appalling and the challenges where you've to 
swipe multiple objects in a certain way in rapid succession to unlock 
something? - don't even get me started - frustrating doesn't even begin 
to describe it. All of which leads me to believe I made a horrible 
mistake in buying Zelda. If I hate Okami and Final Fantasy VII, I'll 
most likely hate Zelda - right? And if I hate Zelda and Final Fantasy 
VII - two of the most-loved games of all time - how can I possibly call 
myself a Gamer?
