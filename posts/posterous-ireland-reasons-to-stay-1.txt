<p>Ireland. It's not all doom and gloom you know. It's actually pretty nice when the sun is shining, and there's very little chance you'll wake up one morning to find one of these on your kitchen ceiling. <br />If you encounter such a spider in the house where you live, do not panic. Calmly and quietly leave the house, drive to the nearest airport and book a one way ticket home to Ireland where no such beasties will ever trouble you again. <br />I don't think humans and giant jumping spiders are meant to share the same living space. Come to think of it I don't think they should be on the same land-mass, or the same planet for that matter.</p>
