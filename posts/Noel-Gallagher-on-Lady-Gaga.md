# Publicity-hungry Noel Gallagher slams publicity-hungry Lady Gaga

## 2011/10/01 06:48

He might be more than a decade past his prime but Noel Gallagher is 
still good for a sound-bite. This time he takes aim at Lady Gaga, 
calling her [Madonna-Lite][1]. It makes [good copy][2] but Noel is old 
enough (just 4 years older than myself) to remember Madonna in her day. 

Yes, Madonna (like Lady Gaga) was publicity-hungry but I don't remember 
her having the talent to perform any of her songs solo with just a piano 
and her own voice.

Kids these days have it so much better. Gaga is a better class of 
pop-star than Madonna ever was. I'm not a fan of Lady Gaga or Noel 
Gallagher, I just don't want to turn into my Dad when it comes to 
pop-music, so I pay attention. I suspect Noel pays attention too and 
might be hungry for some publicity given he has an album coming out. He 
pulls the oldest trick in the book (celebrity A slams celebrity B as 
'publicity-hungry') and the media dutifully falls for it. Page-views for 
online media outlets, record sales for Noel. Everybody wins.
