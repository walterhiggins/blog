# Why you should use Emacs.

Just when I was about to write about 'why emacs is my most favourite
editor ever', I discover <a
href="http://www.livingtorah.org/~csebold/emacs/why.phtml">this</a>. A
pretty good summation of my own experiences and likes/dislikes wrt
emacs. Well worth reading if you have the time. I've been called 'The
reverend moon of Emacs' by co-workers from time to time. I'm typical
of most Emacs users in that I tend to evangelise it when I get the
opportunity.
