  <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Setting up Apple TV is about as simple as it gets. Just plug the power lead into the wall and connect Apple TV to your widescreen TV using an HDMI cable (sold separately). Since everything streams wirelessly to Apple TV, that's all you need. Well, that and a comfy sofa.</blockquote>

<p>Wait a minute. Where does the streaming content come from? The Sofa?</p></div>
