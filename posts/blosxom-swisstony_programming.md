But first an introduction. Joe Drumgoole made <a href="http://joedrumgoole.com/blog/2009/02/10/the-tuesday-push-twitter-mosaic/">some deeply cutting remarks</a> about my love
for the Perl programming language, alluding to a proclivity for
stilleto heels and cat-o-9-tails. A slur which I feel compelled to
refute. I am a Perl Programmer. I am not a masochist. I am a loverman
(Perl's motto is "There's more than one way to do it"). So I have
called on that most debonnaire of lovermen to put things right. Take
it away Tones...</em>

You know they say that computer programming is very much like making
love to a beautiful woman. And I should know I've bedded a few
lovelies in my time...
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Javascript</h3>
<p>Ah Javascript. Sweet, lithe, Javascript. Your svelte, elegant charms
were so beguiling. When you took me back to your place I couldn't
believe my luck. Then when you suggested we invite your girlfriend DOM
around ... well ... it would have been rude to refuse. Admittedly DOM
wasn't what I expected, as ugly as a bag of chisels but still... You
never turn down a threesome.
</p>
<p>When they suggested their friends Firefox and Safari join the party
I was - I'll admit - rather pleased with myself. Then just as things were
getting interesting, my psychotic Ex, Internet Explorer crashed the
party and threw a hissy fit. She insisted I spend the rest of the
night with
her. I did, gently talking her down from her hysteria. The next
morning I awoke, chastened and wondering if it had all been worth it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Java. Java. Java. How you made me call your name over and over. And
that peculiar grammar of yours...
<pre><code>
swissTony.makeLoveTo(me,ALL_NIGHT_LONG);
</code></pre>
<p>You wanted me to treat you like an object and I dutifully obliged.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>COBOL</h3>
<p>I don't make love to women of a certain age, no matter how
appreciative they might be. However I will make an exception for...
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Lisp</h3>
<p>Lisp may be getting on in years but believe me there's life in the
old dog yet. Just look at those curvy braces, inviting you to grab
them and roll around the floor naked. Admittedly I've never had the
pleasure but just look at those voluptous semi-round braces... 
<pre><code>(defun queue-full-p (queue)
  "Return T if QUEUE is full."
  (check-type queue queue)
  (= (queue-get-ptr queue) 
     (queue-next queue (queue-put-ptr queue))))</code></pre>
...If I were to ever bed Lisp I
think there would be handcuffs involved. And lots of them.
</p>
</li>					 
</ol>
<p>So there you go gentelmen. I hope my little parlay around the ins
and outs of programming languages has been educational. This is Swiss
Tony - signing off.
