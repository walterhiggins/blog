<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><img src="http://arbesman.net/milkyway/mwtaSmall.png" align="left" alt="" />Our galaxy is unimaginably vast, and we really have no idea what is out there. We are discovering <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/">new planets in other star systems</a> all the time, learning new facts about the <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/%7Eghezgroup/gc/">galactic core</a>, and even learning about <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4959-milky-way-spiral-gets-an-extra-arm.html">whole new portions of the galaxy</a>. This map is an attempt to approach our galaxy with a bit more familiarity than usual and get people thinking about long-term possibilities in outer space. Hopefully it can provide as a useful shorthand for our place in the Milky Way, the 'important' sights, and make inconceivable distances a bit less daunting.</blockquote>
