# President's music

## 2011/10/24 08:45

There was an item on the radio this morning where each of the 
presidential candidates were asked what music they liked. 

 - Dana Scanlon : Dusty Springfield. Fair enough. 
 - Martin McGuiness: The Bee Gees. The Wolfe Tones. Hmmm. 
 - Michael D. Higgins: The Saw Doctors. The Stunning. (I seriously doubt 
   Michael D. likes The Stunning - this sounds like blatant pandering to 
   his Galway Constituency)
 - Gay Mitchell or Sean Gallagher (I'm not sure which - they sound alike): 
   Garth Brooks, The Corrs, Andrea Corr. :-O
 - Mary Davis: Imelda May.
 - David Norris: Mr. Norris began a passionate eulogy on Edith Piaf (and 
   some other french singer I didn't catch the name of). Of all the 
   candidates he struck me as the only one who actually loves music. 

While I don't share his taste in music, if this was a vote based on 
musical tastes, Norris would get my vote for one simple reason. He 
obviously doesn't give a fuck what the Irish electorate think of his 
musical tastes and has no interest in pandering to a nation whose 
musical touchstones are Garth Brooks, The Saw Doctors and The Corrs. And I like that about the man.
