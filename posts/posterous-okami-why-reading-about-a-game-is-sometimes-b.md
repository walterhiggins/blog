# Okami - Why reading about a game is sometimes better than actually playing it.

I love Michael Abbott's BrainyGamer blog. Absolutely Love It! Michael 
Abbott is to Video games what Pauline Kael was to Movies. Like Pauline 
Kael on movies, his writing is often more enjoyable than the subject of 
his writing.
Okami sadly proves this point. I bought Okami based on Michael's glowing 
critique (Michael is at pains to point out that - like Pauline Kael - he 
doesn't write 'reviews') and while initial impressions are that yes - it 
is beautiful, I can't see myself playing this game much. The reasons are simple...
1. The game is frustrating in that there's just no way to sneak around 
bad guys. This is bad. You can see them coming and even though you walk 
around them they somehow detect your presence and swoop in on you. 
2. The battle is repetitive, boring and unintuitive. Not much more to be said.
3. The are reams of cut-scenes / speech boxes that break the flow of the game. Simply put - this game has no flow.
4. There's a couple of special drawing moves you have to do where you 
draw on the screen with the Wii remote. One move in particular - 
Susano's Imploding-Explosions - broke my spirit and basically made me 
give up on the game.

I'm afraid you're wrong on this one Michael, I suspect people ignored it 
because the gameplay sucked, not because of its theme. The game is 
beautiful and is very 'japanese' - I don't have a problem with that, I 
liked the story and the game's world. What I have a problem with is 
choppy flow, and frustrating controls.
The game it reminded most of was Final Fantasy VII - especially the 
battle sequences and blocks of text. That was another game I just could 
not get into (I kept getting killed by the same bad guys at a certain 
point in the game).
