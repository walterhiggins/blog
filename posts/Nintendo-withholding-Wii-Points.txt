# Nintendo withholding Wii Points 

## 2012/01/18 00:14

Update: It turns out Nintendo weren't withholding Wii Points they just 
make it insanely bloody difficult to find them. Here's how in case you 
find yourself in a similar pickle... 

1. Go to https://wiipointscard.nintendo-europe.com/php/index.php?lang=en_GB and 
login using your club nintendo credentials. 

2. Once you've signed in go 
to the bottom right of the page (the 'Information' section and click on 
the 'Your Nintendo Points number' link. 

3. This page lists all of the 

Nintendo eShop Activation codes which you use to buy Wii points using 
the Wii Shop channel on your wii. (click 'Add Wii Points' then 'Redeem 
Nintendo eShop Card' on your Wii.

Nintendo really need to make this less of a chore. The path from the 
Club Nintendo website to the Wii Points card shop website is non-obvious 
so it took me about half a dozen clicks to get there.

End Update:

Over the Christmas period I bought a bunch of Wii Games and on 10th 
January 2012 registered them online at the [ClubNintendo][1] website. 
Registering your games entitles you to Club Nintendo Stars which in turn 
can be redeemed as Wii Points which in turn can be used to buy games on 
the Wii Shop channel. Integration between Nintendo's Wii Shop channel 
and Club Nintendo is kind of clunky and goofy. The whole Club Nintendo 
Stars vs. Wii Points for a start - not exactly straightforward (that 
might be by design). 

Registering a game like Zelda: Skyward Sword can net you up to 250 Club 
Nintendo Stars. When you've accumulated say 1200 stars you can redeem 
these for a 300 Nintendo Points Card (value: 3 Euro). *On 9th and 10th 
January I redeemed a total of 1600 Club Nintendo stars for 400 Nintendo 
Points but eight days later I still don't see these additional points in 
my Wii Shop channel on the Wii*. I've redeemed stars for Nintendo points 
cards before and the process is usually instantaneous. Yes I've 
connected my Club Nintendo account to my Wii Shop Channel on the Wii.
Of course [I reported the problem on Club Nintendo's official site][2] 
but that seems to be a black hole. I've heard absolutely nothing from 
Nintendo. 4 Euro might not seem like much but it's 4 euro Nintendo are 
withholding from me. This might be an issue for other Nintendo 
customers too. All those with-held Wii points could quickly add up. I've 
been a happy Wii customer for more than 4 years but if this is how 
Nintendo treat customers I'll be spending my hard-earned cash on another 
platform. I felt compelled to blog about this because there has been no 
response from Nintendo, not even an indication that they are looking 
into the issue. Here's hoping they fix things soon.

These are the entries that show up in my Club Nintendo account Activity log...

10/01/2012 Wii Points purchase Nintendo Points -1200  

09/01/2012 Wii Points purchase Nintendo Points -400

There are no equivalent entries in the account activity on my Wii Shop Channel.
