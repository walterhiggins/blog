# Track by Track. Day 1: The Information
## 2011/10/08 13:48
This is the first in a series of posts about songs from my [Ode to Voyager][1] album.
[Saganism: The Information](sounds/01 The Information.mp3) 
The opening track is I think one of the strongest tracks on the album 
and in the best tradition of first songs, is a statement of intent. It 
came together in less than 2 hours one saturday afternoon. I had only 
started dabbling with Garageband on iPad and was messing about, 
combining an arpeggiated keyboard with smart guitar. The riff came 
together pretty quickly. Adding the NASA samples was a no-brainer. I've 
been trawling the web for NASA audio for a while now. I can't get enough 
of that stuff.
The Orb's U.F.Orb is a very special album for me. Whenever I hear it I'm 
transported back to the time and place I first heard it (A rainy 
saturday afternoon in September 1992, in San Sebastian, Spain). On that 
album they took the use of samples to a whole new level. I like to think 
_The Information_ is a feel-good song - it makes me feel good. It's full 
of hope and aspiration like the Voyager mission itself. The sample that 
starts the song is of course the audio recordings of greetings in 
different languages that were etched on to the gold disc that Voyager 
carries. _The Information_ refers to the information sent and received 
by Voyager during its long trip through space. This is what MP3Hugger 
had to say about it...

I made a lo-fi video for this track. It's basically clips from the 
Voyager online archive with some light editing.

Voyager is now the fastest and most distant man made object. It has 
passed beyond our solar system and is some 13 billion miles from home 
and still travelling thanks to its plutonium power source.
