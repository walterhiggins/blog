# Track by Track. Day 9: Yaw

[Saganism: Yaw](sounds/09 Yaw.mp3)

Originally one of 3 tracks called Roll, Pitch and Yaw, this is - I hate 
to admit - one of the weaker tracks on the album. If I was to drop any 
track from the album, this would be first to go. I like the piano but in 
retrospect the guitar just doesn't add anything. At 2 minutes 53 seconds 
it's too long and repetitive. Oh and it's forgetable too. It just 
doesn't go anywhere. OK, I think I've hated on this enough. Onwards and upwards.
