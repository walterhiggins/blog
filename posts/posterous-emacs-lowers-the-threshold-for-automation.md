# Emacs lowers the threshold for automation

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">My threshold for automation is lower than most people's. When faced with a repetitive task that will take me an afternoon to do, I'll spend maybe half an hour understanding the task, an hour figuring out how to do it using the tools, and another half hour to an hour completing it with automation's help. I spend the extra time learning more about the automation tools or sharing what I've done.</blockquote>

<p>Sacha nails it. Emacs lowers the threshold for automating text editing so much that there really is no longer a clear distinction between editing and automating. In any other IDE there is a high threshold for automating - want to automate some code editing in eclipse? - Better start reading up on Eclipse's plug-in API and write some Java code. Want to start automating in emacs? - well look no further than Paul Ford's excellent 'Emacs Notepad' <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/util_emacs_hints.html">http://www.ftrain.com/util_emacs_hints.html</a> to get a feel for just how easy it is. With Emacs, text-editing and text-editing automation are on the same continuum.</p>
