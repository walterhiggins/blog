<p>I'll make a prediction, too. We will <strong>not</strong> be able to plug a single unknown protein sequence into a computer and have it derive a complete description of all of its functions by 2020. Conceivably, we could replace this step with a complete, experimentally derived quantitative summary of all of the functions and interactions of every protein involved in brain development and function, but I guarantee you that won't happen either. And that's just the first step in building a simulation of the human brain derived from genomic data. It gets harder from there.</p>
<p>I'll make one more prediction. The media will not end their infatuation with this pseudo-scientific dingbat, Kurzweil, no matter how uninformed and ridiculous his claims get.</p>

<p>Why Ray Kurzweil's "mind upload" is not going to happen anytime soon. Personally I think immortality is over-rated.</p>
