# No biggie

## 2011/11/11 14:54

Just deleted my Google+ account. It was no biggie.  

I would delete my facebook account but for the following...

1. I have a facebook App - Pixenate that I'd like to keep around
2. I have a handful of relatives and old friends I don't have any other way to contact.

I hardened up the privacy settings and trimmed the friends list to a number I can count on 2 hands. I never spent much time on Facebook so - again - no biggie.
