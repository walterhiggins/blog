# Taste of Cork. What a ripoff. Never again.

<p>I spent this afternoon at the <a href="http://www.tastefest.ie/">Taste of Cork food festival</a> in Fitzgerald Park. It cost us &euro;30 euro to get in to the festival. That &euro;30 didn't include any free food. Once we paid for the privilege of entering the food festival grounds, we were gouged at every turn. We won't be going back.</p>
<p>The warning signs were there but I ignored them. First there was the entrance fee. &euro;30 euro for two "early-bird" tickets should have raised alarm bells but I went ahead anyway. I figured, well - it must be something really special if they're charging such a high entrance fee - right? Wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next warning sign was the special 'currency' the stalls use, called 'Corkers'. You don't pay cash at the stall, instead you use these vouchers called corkers. Cute huh? One euro is equivalent to one Corker. I guess the reasoning behind this is obvious and I should have seen it. After all it's easier for exhibitors (Artisan Ice-cream and hot-dog vendors) to look you in the eye when asking for 3 'Corkers' in exchange for a tiny scoop of Ice-cream as <a href="http://www.baldwinsicecream.com/">Baldwin's Ice Cream</a> did. If the goal of <a href="http://www.tastefest.ie/">Taste of Cork</a> was to promote local food producers I'd say they've done a terrible job. Thanks to today's experience, I am pretty certain <a href="http://www.baldwinsicecream.com/">Baldwin's Ice Cream</a> will never get another cent from me. Seriously, if you are a cork-based food producer, what business have you exhibiting at this festival? The high entrance fee left a bitter taste for many people (some unfortunate souls had to pay &euro;25 euro at the gate). If you want to show-case your produce, don't do it here. From what I heard, the costs for exhibitors was high - I don't know how true that is but passing on that cost to your customers is not the best way to get a foot-hold with consumers.</p>
<p>It is pretty galling to be charged &euro;30 euro entrance fee then asked for &euro;6 euro for two measly scoops of ice cream. This is the Taste of Cork experience for me. We spent a total of &euro;70 euro today and this is what we got for it:</p>
<p>Entrance into Taste of Cork food festival.<br />2 Bottles of still water:<br />2 Scoops of Ice cream:&nbsp;<br />2 portions of Fish &amp; Chips (these were 'Artisan' portions so it was one finger of battered cod and half a dozen chips) + 1 portion of calamari<br />1 box of 9 mini-cupcakes (you couldn't buy them singly)<br />1 glass of Prosecco white wine.</p>
<p>&euro;70 euro for that lot. What a fucking rip-off. Needless to say, I won't be going back.&nbsp;</p>
