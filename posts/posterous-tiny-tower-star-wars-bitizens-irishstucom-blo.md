A brilliant collection of Tiny Tower citizens. It takes real skill to create these sprites and still make each character instantly recognizable. Stewart Curry has done an amazing job here. My 5 year old instantly recognized each one. Also check out [his other Bitizen characters](http://irishstu.com/stublog). Looking at these I was reminded of [Susan Kare](http://library.stanford.edu/mac/primary/interviews/kare/trans.html) and the work she did at Apple on the famous Moof sprite. Pixel art is hard.
