# First impressions of HTC Desire

<p>Despite earlier reservations I went ahead and got a HTC Desire. My mobile network is Meteor in Ireland. Here (in no particular order) are my first impressions after a few hours using the phone...</p>
<ul>
<li>The screen is gorgeous. Very bright - no pixellation.</li>
<li>The first-time setup wizard asks you to enter your Facebook, Flickr and Twitter credentials. It then harvest all your facebook contacts and adds them to your address book alongside your SIMs contacts. Very impressive and just a little scary.</li>
<li>It's not an iPhone. "Touch" is just slightly off. It's slightly disconcerting that the first-time touch calibration (I've done this 3 times now) always tells me I've pressed R instead of E etc. The keyboard feels smaller and I make more mistakes typing on the Desire than I do on an iPhone.</li>
<li>No paid Apps. That's right. If you're on Meteor in Ireland, you cannot see - let alone buy - paid apps. What The Fuck?</li>
<li>It's not an iPhone. The selection of Apps is smaller and a lot of apps are strewn with ads. The Android market place is a flea-market compared to Apple's App Store. There are no big-name marquee apps.</li>
<li>The gyro is flaky. Switching between portrait and landscape doesn't work sometimes. You sometimes need to tap the side of the phone for the screen to adjust.</li>
<li>Not to bang on about this but ... it isn't an iPhone. No educational Apps like 'First Words Animals', 'First Words Deluxe'. No 'Trope' etc. The kids' verdict is they prefer the iPhone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe, given time (and hopefully the eventual availability of paid apps) I'll grow to like this phone. I think HTC should at least try to make the Desire's Touch feel a little more iPhone-like since that's what a lot of people are going to use as a reference. I think it's fair to say the iPhone has the canonical Touch experience and any phone that doesn't quite feel like an iPhone is going to suffer.</p>
