Some of these truths really do hurt...

> * The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be

Yikes! The first programming language I was exposed to was BASIC 
(ZX-BASIC). I learnt it while still in my teens. The language I excelled 
at in college (the only language subject I got a 100% mark for) was 
COBOL. By Dijkstra's reckoning, I shouldn't be allowed near a computer 
;-) The essay was first published in 1975 but as Joe Drumgoole says, 
most of these are still true today. 

> PL/I --"the fatal disease"-- belongs more to the problem set than to the solution set.

This one made me think of Java and this recent Tweet...
