# That one time I never met Steve Jobs

"Wanna go for lunch with Guy Kawasaki?"
"Sure" I said, trying my hardest to sound like I didn't care. It was 
July 1997 and I was on my first assignment to Cupertino. I had been 
working in Apple over a year and this had been my first trip to the U.S. 
My first time in America, Silicon Valley and Infinite Loop. Some of my 
team were friends of Guy. Guy Kawasaki wasn't the Social Media maven 
he is now, he was still working at Apple and hadn't yet founded 
Garage.com. Guy was part of Apple folklore - the only Apple Fellow (at 
the time) who wasn't a software or hardware engineer, and he already had 
a couple of books under his belt. Was I going to turn down a chance to 
have lunch with Guy Kawasaki at Cafe Mac ? No way!
So we had lunch. Which was nice. We munched on burgers and curly fries 
and chatted about the latest movies we'd seen that week (Batman Forever, 
Men in Black), technology and parenting (which I didn't have much to say 
about at the time. Side note: this was the first time I had ever heard 
someone use the word 'parenting' - I had never heard 'parent' used as a 
verb before). Guy has a magnetic personality and I was a little 
star-struck. After lunch we all headed back to his office (I had read 
The Computer Curmudgeon so Guy offered a copy of his latest book). We 
entered a tall building - the tallest on the campus - all the executive 
offices were located here. I headed for the elevator in the lobby but 
Guy stopped me. "Let's take the stairs." he said.
While ascending the stairs, Guy explained that recently-returned Steve 
Jobs's office was in this very building and that no one dared use the elevator, 
fearing they'd be doorstepped by Jobs who would grill them about what 
they were working on. Steve Jobs had only just returned to the company 
but his reputation was formidable. In July 1997, even before he had 
turned Apple around and brought it back from the brink to where it is 
today - the biggest company in the world - Steve Jobs was feared and 
respected. Although diminished in health, today his power and influence 
can be felt far beyond the confines of that executive building in Cupertino.
I wish I'd taken the elevator. It would have been worth it.
