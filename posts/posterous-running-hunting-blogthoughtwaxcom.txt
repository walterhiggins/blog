<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">In many ways, running is pointless. Unless you're doing it solely for fun, you're simply working to undo all of the great things that society or your lifestyle has made available to you. You're working, not to earn, but to lose what you've received almost for free: an abundance of cheap food, and an absence of manual labour to burn it off.</blockquote>
