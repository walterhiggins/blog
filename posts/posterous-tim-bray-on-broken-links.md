  <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p class="p1">Before events took this bad turn, the contract represented by a link was
simple: "Here's a string, send it off to a server and the server will figure
out what it identifies and send you back a representation."  Now it's along
the lines of: "Here's a string, save the hashbang, send the rest to the server,
and rely on being able to run the code the server sends you to use the
hashbang to generate the representation."<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/02/09/Hash-Blecch#p-3" class="plink"> ¶</a></p>

<p>Do I need to explain why this is less robust and
flexible?  This is what we call "tight coupling" and I thought that anyone
with a Computer Science degree ought to have been taught to avoid it.</p></blockquote>

<p>A URL is a promise of content.
<br />The deferred-payload-via-javascript approach feels like a huge step backwards.</p></div>
