<p>Thrun, seeking to reassure anyone worried about the risk posed by an automated car in the California experiment, said: "Our cars are never unmanned. We always have a trained safety driver behind the wheel who can take over as easily as one disengages cruise control. And we also have a trained software operator in the passenger seat to monitor the software." Local police are also briefed.</p>
<p>He added: "While this project is very much in the experimental stage, it provides a glimpse of what transportation might look like in the future thanks to advanced computer science."</p>

<p>OK Google. Wave and it's stupid cumbersome counter-intuitive scroll bars was bad enough. If you can't program basic computer user-interface controls like scroll-bars I certainly don't trust you to write software that drives a 1-ton vehicle at 60mph. <br />Cut that shit out. You're scaring me. Seriously.</p>
