When you learn Haskell, you > similarly learn a body of technique for solving problems with lazy lists > and monads. These kinds of powerful general-purpose tools are at the > forefront of the language.>  > But when you learn Java, there aren't any powerful language features you > can use to solve many problems. Instead, you spend your time learning a > body of technique for solving problems in the language. Java has hashes, > but if you are aware of them at all, they are just another piece of the > immense Collections library, lost among the many other sorts of > collections, and you have no particular reason to know about them or > think about them.  > -- [The Universe of Discourse : Why I like Java][1][1]: http://blog.plover.com/prog/Java.html## Categoriesjava
