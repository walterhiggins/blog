# Chest Pains

It seemed she could see them in her dreams. Ever present pin pricks of
light criss-crossing beneath her eyelids. She opened her eyes and sat
upright. A gentle chorus of voices came to life joined by violins and
what sounded like a harp. Some velvet-voiced crooner from the last
century was singing. Kim was only dimly aware of the music as she
dressed and prepared for her shift. Through a porthole she glimpsed a
jutting peninsula sparsely covered with wisps of white cloud. Judging
by the smooth moccasin coloured terrain, they were somewhere high
above the equator. 

She took some coffee and left her sleeping quarters. A short narrow
hallway led to the observatory. Soft music echoed from the PA system. 

> ...two drifters,  
> off to see the world,  
> there's such a lot of world,  
> to see..."  


The observatory door slid open noiselessly.  
"Evening, sleepy head" Robert greeted her cheerily.  
"Oh god - I'm not late, am I?" Kim knew she had overslept.  
"Just an hour. Its no trouble"  
Kim craned her head upwards and there it was. Earth. Like some
impossibly massive, iridescent blue Marble. Seen from the orbiting
observatory, it's immensity and proximity was terrifying, it's beauty
intoxicating. 

"What are our coordinates?" Kim asked sipping the last of her coffee.  
"10:00:13 latitude, 270:14:05 longtitude, 500km altitude. There was a
gamma ray burst half an hour ago, 20 seconds duration - we have a
photometry report from Ulysses". Robert was well suited to the
monastic life up here. He enjoyed immersing himself in the minutiae of
observational data gathered here and in other satellites. Although
junior in rank, Robert had made an indelible mark on life in the
observatory. The constant background music was from his personal
library.

"Thanks Robert, you can get some sleep now" Kim said putting her
coffee down and sitting into the observatory seat. Slowly the seat
reclined so that the Earth filled her field of vision. The enormity of
it was truly breath taking. The sight of it was as much a visceral as
a visual experience.

> like you've had too much wine,  
> that's amore..."  

The satellite was over the Indian Ocean. To the west she could see as
far as Corsica brightly lit by daylight, in the east, still in
darkness she could see the outline of Japan. Much of Afghanistan was
clearly visible, a great swirl of mountain range running through it
like the fingerprint of a god. Arabia stretched out before her like
some roughly cut animal hide. The Nile and it's delta, like a woman's
sex. The peninsula she had glimpsed through the porthole must have
been Somalia and the gulf of Aden. For a moment she let her focus
drift - it was difficult for the mind's eye to encompass the view
before her. Kim figured it just wasn't possible, the human mind wasn't
wired to appreciate such a massively large object but sometimes
momentarily she imagined she could. She pitied the early astronauts,
their view confined to a porthole. Such a waste. All that effort to
get up here for such a poor window on the world. She often spent hours
sitting here, looking at the world, imagining what was happening on
the surface. All the human trials and tribulations, up here they
seemed so remote, like her life on earth was just a dream. 'Finlandia'
was playing over the PA system. A sparse haunting melody. 

Kim never cared much for classical or easy listening music back home
but up here it was all people ever listened to. It suited perfectly
the grand vista before her. Sometimes she hankered for earthly things,
the hustle and bustle of big city life, but not often. Three years in
orbit had distanced her from life on earth. During her stay, she had
occasionally wondered what life would be like when she returned to
surface. The thought of going back filled her with a mix of
expectation and dread. She would miss the observatory so much. The
view, the people, the haunting arias she had listened to time and
again but didn't know by name. She barely remembered what it was like
to see sky and trees, to feel soft grass beneath her feet, or sand
between her toes. That would be good. Life on earth wasn't so bad was
it? She would go back to a good research position. 

She sat staring at the immense looming orb and imagined a tiny earth
within her. A little earth, hard as a diamond, nestled between her
heart and lungs. She imagined this little earth aching to return to
its parent, tugging at her from within, pulling her to the
surface. Sometimes in her sleep the little earth grew, pushing against
her ribs, crowding out her vital organs, making breathing
difficult. She would wake up breathless and clutching her chest.

Insomnia was a problem for everyone up here, but the chest pains. They
troubled her. Eventually she talked to the on board medic. It was the
worst news she could have heard. She would have to go back down. The
medic could not say for certain what was wrong. She would have to see
a specialist. Even if it turned out to be something minor, she would
more than likely not be coming back up for some time. Three years was
a long time in space. The cosmic rays had no doubt played their part
in her illness. 

She looked towards the Mediterranean. It looked beautiful, a lustrous
blue sun-kissed lagoon. She stared for a long time hoping the image
would burn itself into her memory but when she closed her eyes all she
saw were microscopic wisps of light. Not even real light but the
ghostly trails left by cosmic rays passing through an optic nerve, en
route to the edge of the universe. Tears welled up from nowhere. Earth
was truly beautiful from afar. Hot tears streamed down her cheeks as
she blew a kiss at the looming orb. She signed off for the last time
and promised herself she would go to Italy when she was better.
