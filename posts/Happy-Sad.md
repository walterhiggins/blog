My new ThinkPad X1 Carbon arrived on Monday. Sadly the build quality
is not as good as the MacBook Air - which really is a beautiful little
computer. The new ThinkPad has 8 GB ram and a 256 GB SSD - it's fast
and with Ubuntu running on it, I get a warm fuzzy feeling. The one
major complaint I have is the bezel on the front right is slightly
warped - the screws at the bottom don't fully engage with the top
bezel leaving a small but perceptible gap. I expected better build
quality for a ThinkPad (this is my 2nd ThinkPad for personal use - I
use a ThinkPad at work too). I'll probably have to send it back for
repair or a replacement.
