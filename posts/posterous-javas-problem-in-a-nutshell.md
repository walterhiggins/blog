<p>Man, look at yourself. You've really let yourself go. You're middle-aged and bloated. Where did it all go wrong? Was it Generics, JAXB? Back in the 1.3 days - sure you were piling on the pounds, but now at 5.0 you're positively obese.</p>
<p>For those with an interest in such things, the book at the bottom is O'Reilly's 3rd edition covering Java 1.3 and weighs in at just 648 pages incl. index. The book at the top is O'Reilly's 5th edition and weighs in at a whopping 1,225 pages! I don't think O'Reilly can justify this book's inclusion in the "Nutshell" series.</p>
