> I saw Quora&#146;s potential early on &#151; it could have been a giant repository

> from everywhere. And certainly, there are still very interesting 
> questions being asked (this one and this one came in my Quora weekly 
> digest, and were pretty interesting). But it&#146;s all being overrun with 
> meaningless questions. Put simply, it&#146;s just hard to filter through all 
> the noise to get to the worthwhile content. That&#146;s one reason why I 
> visit the site maybe once a month, and just read the weekly digest instead.

> Finally, and this was the last straw, in the fall, when there was the 
> smell of snow, we allowed six men and a girl-child of the Waterfall 
> People to enter our home, all six hungry and weak, and I was asked if I 
> could shelter two of the men in my already very-crowded cave, as if it 
> was my job to teach strangers the ways of the Red Valley People, and 
> asked to share my smoked deer meat&#151;even though it was never made clear 
> to me exactly how much smoked deer I should be giving to the People. 
> That's when I began to wonder exactly why I had joined the Red Valley People.
