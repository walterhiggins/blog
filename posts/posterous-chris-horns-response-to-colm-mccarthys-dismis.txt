  <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">It seems obvious that the world has changed over the last decade. It seems clear that restoring our national competitiveness to pre-bubble levels is insufficient. It seems apparent that getting more output from each unit of input is deficient. Instead, we need to create value, rather than volume. If we can create high-value services and goods for the international markets, then we will create economic wealth and sustainable employment, freed from the vagaries of an international race to the bottom.</blockquote>
