# Running## 2013/08/20 19:38I've caught the Running bug. Bad. By "Running" I mean "Jogging-like-an-old-man" but it has me in its grip. I started just a few weeks ago (July 24th 2013 to be exact) but I've been running almost every day since. Except today. I banjaxed my leg on Monday morning after a 3.5 mile run. I've been doing 5k runs every morning for the last fortnight. On the previous Sunday I'd done two 5k runs before 11 am (taking a break between the two) so this Sunday I pushed myself further and did 8.2k without a break. I felt a little stiff afterwards in the hip but it went away. Then yesterday morning I did my usual run (actually a little longer - 3.5 miles) and afterwards found walking difficult. I went into work but getting up from my desk and just getting about the office was painful and slow so I went to my GP who said I banjaxed my 'Glutes'. Glutes - I never even knew I had them until I fecked one up. I'm a little bit embarrassed about this - I'm new to running (and sports injuries in general) and it looks like I've made a classic beginner mistake of pushing too hard too soon. Even so, I have to say - Running is addicting. This is coming from someone who doesn't like sports of any kind. I've been running every morning - first thing when I wake up. What I love about it is it's low on ceremony - I just put on a T-Shirt, Shorts and Runners and I'm gone. At first I was taking my phone and ear-plugs to listen to music while running but the ear-plugs wouldn't stay in and fiddling with the music player while running was a pain. I've stopped bringing the ear-plugs but just signed up to [strava][1] and they have an android app so I used that on my last run (monday). The data itself might not be impressive (3.5 miles in 35 minutes) but my god look at the presentation! Below is a blog widget but if you go direct to the [activity link][5] you can zoom in on the map and even see which side of the roads I was running on - mad stuff! Never has so much data been processed and rendered so beautifully for such a mediocre performance. I'm sure actual athletes must *love* this level of detail. For a beginner like me it's an embarrassment of riches. <iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://www.strava.com/activities/75809425/embed/58f9454c3967b975e578c5325e5c111f7100c1e7'></iframe>A couple of things about the strava app... 1. It seems to be primarily concerned with acquiring more users. The first screen urges you to 'Find Friends' when it should just have a big 'Start Run' button. 2. It's focused more on Cycling than Running. I can live with this. 3. Like all Silicon Valley based social networks its copy has that breezy ever so slightly cloying boosterish tone. "Hey, you're kind of a big deal!" - please. 4. I've been followed by a few folks and am following a few folks back but I'm not entirely sure I'm comfortable with this yet. What if I relapse back into couch potato mode?Being a bit of a techie, part of the fun of Running is reading up on [Running blogs][2], checking out what upcoming local races are on, and of course reading up on the gadgets. I just ordered a [Garmin ForeRunner 10][3] GPS watch because even lugging the Android phone around seems like to much baggage. The watch is in the post so hopefully I can get back to running by the time it's delivered. The GP has told me to take a break from running for a week. I'm going to ease back into it next week hopefully, do a couple of 3ks and slowly work back up to 5k. Can't wait to get back into it. BTW If you haven't already seen it go read [The Oatmeal on Running][4]. ## CategoriesRunning[1]: http://strava.com/[2]: http://corkrunning.blogspot.ie/[3]: https://buy.garmin.com/en-IE/GB/sports/running-fitness/forerunner-10/prod107143.html[4]: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running[5]: http://www.strava.com/activities/75809425
