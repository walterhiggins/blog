I owe my life to two old Spanish men who saved me from drowning.  I
don't know anything about the men who saved me, other than they were
old but strong swimmers.  I was young, 21 at the time, and
overestimated my strength as a swimmer.  I had just moved to San
Sebastian 2 weeks previously.  It would have been tragic if I had
died.  I imagine it would have hit my mother hard.  She was already
suffering ill health and had worried about me moving abroad.

The buoy was about a quarter of a mile from shore.  It was a large 15
foot square buoy with a diving board and slide.  I had noticed it the
first day in San Sebastian.  I shared an apartment in the El Antiguo
district, just 10 minutes walk from the beach.  The buoy was
irresistible. Sometimes it looked like it would sink with so many
people on it.  Other times there were only one or two older swimmers,
who used it as a rest point on their way to Santa Clara Island in the
middle of the bay.  On this particular evening there were only a few
people on the beach.  A couple walking a dog, a young woman reading,
two old ladies towelling themselves after a swim, their conversation,
guttural and jovial, and two old men waist-high in the water,
limbering up.  The buoy was unoccupied. I was a terrible judge of both
distance and my own ability.  I planned to swim out to the buoy, rest,
then dive from the board a while, before returning to shore.  At this
stage, I wasn't a strong, confident swimmer (I improved later), I
didn't like getting out of my depth, but the lure of the buoy was too
great. I would make a mad dash for it and hope that I could cover the
distance before tiring.  I walked to the water's edge. It was a cool
May evening. The sun was setting behind Mount Igueldo.  The sea was
calm and there were only a few Jellyfish. I walked in up to my chest
and tried to gauge the distance to the buoy.  It didn't look much
closer. I took a deep breath and headed for the buoy.

Like I say, I wasn't a great swimmer. My arms and legs splashed
around.  I was about a hundred metres from shore when I felt my arms
tiring.  Not good I thought, but I continued, hoping I'd make it to
the buoy soon.  I got tired real quick. To this day I can remember the
feeling of exhaustion, panic, and despair as my limbs failed me.  The
dull ache in my useless arms. Had I been more confident in the water I
would have just laid back and threaded water until my strength
returned.  Realizing I wasn't going to make it, I panicked. I stopped
swimming but was too tired to turn around.  That's when I went under.
I tried to gasp for air as I slipped under, but my lungs were burning
from the exertion.

They say drowning is one of the least unpleasant ways to die.  That
you die quickly once the struggle is over.  They also say that you go
under twice before finally sinking.  I came back up and screamed at
the top of my lungs 'Socorro'.  I had learned that word just 2 days
previously.  I knew the two old men must still be in the water but
couldn't see them.

> There are 2 words for 'Help' in the Spanish language.  'Ayudar' is the
> verb 'to help' as in 'help me move this armchair' or 'help me choose a
> color for the living room', whereas 'Socorro' is used in emergencies
> as in 'help - my house is on fire!' or 'help - I'm drowning!'.  Had I
> cried out 'Ayudame' instead of 'Socorro', the urgency of my situation
> might have gone unnoticed and I would not have lived to tell the tale.
> That my life might have hinged on such a misunderstanding, is both
> sobering and comical. Death by bad grammar.

I went under a second time. I Can't remember much. I Was seized by
panic. This was it. My life didn't flash before me.  There were no
revelations. No thoughts even of those I would leave behind, just
blind panic.

I came back up and there they were. Two guardian angels.  Their
mottled, brown wrinkled skin glistening in the fading sunlight.  The
two men were alongside me before I knew it, each one supporting me.
They were strong swimmers but even so, had trouble keeping me afloat
on the way back to the beach.  The old men on San Sebastian's beaches
are by and large, a fit bunch.  They spend their mornings, playing
Pelota or Tennis or swimming or running.  I once played a few matches
of Pelota with one of the old men. I was knackered after an hour but
this old man kept playing.  The old men of La Concha are fit and
strong, and for that, I'm thankful.  Above my own panting and gasping
I heard them gasping for breath amid a conversation.  I didn't
understand a word they said. As soon as the feeling of panic subsided,
a mixture of gratitude and shame (none of which I could articulate)
filled me as we headed back to shore.  The old men were very
gracious. As I squatted on the shore, exhausted and struggling for
breath, all I could say was 'gracias'.  Over and over, between each
deep breath.  One of the men stayed with me for a few minutes to make
sure I was OK.  It was rather awkward as he quickly found out just how
little Spanish I could speak.  To this day, I have never been so
grateful and so ashamed.  Eventually I was left alone, sitting by the
water's edge, gentle waves lapping against my feet.  Even as I
lambasted myself, cursing my foolishness and feeble limbs, I looked
out into the bay and promised myself I would make it to the buoy
within the year.
