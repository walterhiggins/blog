# The Internet Drinks Your Milkshake

There are so many things wrong with the following headline I don't know 
where to begin...
[ValoBox wants to reward content creators and consumers][1]
... The zinger is in the article body though...
> ValoBox is really comprised of two applications, the publishing system 
> and the ValoBox reader.  
Sounds like someone wants to silo and sandbox. Unfeasible! As [Dave 
Winer][2] might say, The Internet zigs to your siloed content zag, or in 
the words of Daniel Day Lewis...
[I drink your milkshake](http://youtu.be/5nQ9YQt7N8s)
... Seriously though, good luck with that proprietary content consumption doohickey.
