[Saganism: Looming Gas Giant](sounds/07 Looming Gas Giant.mp3)

Firefox users can hear it here...

[BandCamp version](http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=4011797785)

This one begins with a low-level interstellar drone, then a strumming
guitar is punctuated by a big fat keyboard riff and rock drums. Most
of the songs on this album were composed more or less the way you hear
them and this is no exception. This is one of my favourite songs on
the album. I like to think it has a [Giorgio Moroder][1] feel to
it. Very nocturnal, a bit brooding and with just a hint of sleaze. 

You can download or buy [Saganism: Ode to Voyager][2].
