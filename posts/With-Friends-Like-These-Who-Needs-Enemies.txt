Wow. Where to begin? First of all, grabbing your friend's names, email 
addresses and phone numbers and handing them over to Google, Microsoft 
or "anywhere else I wanted to put them" - That's Not Cool! That's a dick 
move. Secondly, trying to dress up such a despicable action as "Saving 
the common web"? Wow. I'm actually speechless. For the record, if I ever 
decide to strip-mine your personal data and publish it on the web, it's 
not because I'm a complete Dick with no regard for your privacy, or 
understanding of context and the subtleties of sharing, it's because I'm 
trying to Save the Common Web. Got that?
