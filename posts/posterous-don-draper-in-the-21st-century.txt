<p>It would make a good Mad Men spin-off TV show no? Don Draper is transported to the present day, where he must learn about the new social mores and rules of marketing and advertising in a social-media age.</p>
<p>You can just imagine his reaction when asked what his Facebook marketing strategy is...</p>

<p>Everytime I see a big brand-name with one of those stupid facebook urls like <a href="http://facebook.com/nike">http://facebook.com/nike</a> this is what I picture in my head...</p>

<p>... the willingness of big companies to subjugate their brand to Facebook is perplexing. Don I bet would take a dim view of Facebook advertising. I bet marketing execs will soon look back on this time and wonder what they were thinking.</p>
