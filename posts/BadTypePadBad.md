# Bad TypePad! Bad!## 2012/03/01 10:37The attempt to leave a comment on a blog post that begat a blog post. I only wanted to to leave a comment on [Bernie Goldbach][]'s blog post and when I choose to leave a comment using my Facebook login credentials, this is what TypePad asks for...![TypePad's permission grab][img1]Let's be clear here. If I want to leave a comment on a TypePad blog, there is no reason why TypePad should be allowed to...1. Send me email. 2. Post to Facebook as me. **TypePad may post status messages, notes, photos and videos on my behalf.**3. Access my data any time. **TypePad may access my data when I'm not using the application.**The last 2 are the most egregious. Really TypePad, this is a blatant identity grab. Do you **really** need all those permissions just so I can comment on a TypePad blog? TypePad is going on my [Facebook App blacklist][fbbl].p.s. We have reached an inflection point in the world of blogging when it is easier to write a post on your own blog than it is to comment on another's TypePad blog. This is as it should be :-) [img1]: images/typepad-facebook.png[Bernie Goldbach]: http://www.insideview.ie/irisheyes/2012/03/if-your-business-needs-facebook-you-may-subordinate-google-plusi.html[fbbl]: Don-t-Allow## CategoriesFacebook, TypePad, Security, Privacy, Blogging
