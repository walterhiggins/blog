# Facebook is The Matrix

I'm not sure which of the big datacenters will be first to become 
self-aware but of the current crop (Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook) 
my bet is on Facebook...
Facebook is stage one of The Matrix. In the movie, machines become self 
aware and eventually begin farming humans as an energy source. Facebook 
is seen as a time-sink for attention-seeking narcissists but the 
naysayers have it wrong. The biggest attention seekers aren't the people 
who spend time on Facebook, but Facebook itself. 
Facebook's "Like" buttons are a clever step in it's evolution - an 
almost viral spreading of tendrils into the wider Internet. In compiling 
a vast database of what we humans "Like", it is in fact stockpiling an 
armory for its eventual war of attention on humans. *Our eyeballs are 
the batteries that keep Facebook juiced.*
It's funny how people have a hard time explaining Facebook to people who 
aren't on Facebook. That's because no one can be told what Facebook is, 
you have to sign on for yourself. To quote the movie itself, Facebook...
> ...is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, 
> you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, 
> carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But 
> until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes 
> them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not 
> ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly 
> dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it. 
I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is 
going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going 
to finish now, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't 
want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without Facebook. A 
world without "Likes" and "Pokes", without awkward 'Friend Requests' or 
"Farmville". A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there 
is a choice I leave to you.
