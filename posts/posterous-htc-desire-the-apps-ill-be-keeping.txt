# HTC Desire - The Apps I'll be keeping.
## 2010/05/05 14:59:00 

<p>A full 2 days now with my new HTC Desire and after my initial disappointment I have to say I'm slightly disturbed by how much I love this phone. </p>
<p>No. It's not an iPhone but it is jaw-droppingly gorgeous nonetheless.  Sometimes - just for the hell of it - I bring up the 'Add Program shortcut' list and flick through the list of Apps just coz I can. I don't think I could go back to an iPhone - it would be a step backwards. I wouldn't have said that 2 days ago.</p>
<p>Let's get some things out the way. No - the Android MarketPlace isn't a patch on Apple's AppStore. The MarketPlace is still a flea-market festooned with SoundBoard apps of every Family Guy character (There could be an entire category for Huey Griffin Soundboard Apps). In Ireland the situation is made even worse because Android Paid Apps are not yet available here. As I've recently discovered, it is still possible to find great Apps for Android - you just have to look a little harder. Here are a couple of the (free) Apps I'll be keeping on my HTC Desire...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/sky/skymap/">Google Sky Map.</a> I think the best possible complement you can pay software (or any digital creation) is to say it is indistinguishable from Analog. Looking at the night sky with Google Sky Map on the HTC Desire held aloft reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke's famous saying...</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>

<p><a href="http://listen.googlelabs.com/">Listen</a> . A podcast app with pretty good (Google powered of course) search. In no time I was able to sign up to the Mark Kermode, Stephen Fry and other Podcasts. Kermode and Mayo's podcast is a must-listen one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/maps/">Maps</a>. This App actually comes pre-installed on the HTC Desire but it's worth upgrading to the latest version for the free Turn-by-turn navigation (still in Beta). I haven't road-tested the Turn-by-Turn navigation yet. I had signed up to a yearly &euro;60 satnav subscription for my old Nokia N95 so having free satnav is a big plus.</p>
<p><a href="http://site.layar.com/download/layar-on-your-android/">Layar</a>. Layar is one of those marquee Apps you install on your phone so you can show your friends this new "Augmented Reality" stuff. I find it kind of useful for 2 reasons. 1 It can find people on twitter nearby. 2 Those clever people at <a href="http://www.daft.ie/">Daft.ie</a> (whose iPhone App is like Crack for nosey neighbours) don't have an Android app yet but they do have a Layar plugin, which will show you houses for sale nearby. </p>
<p><a href="http://foursquare.com/android/">FourSquare</a>. I'm not 100% convinced about FourSquare or the usefulness of Checking in to every cafe/bar/venue you visit in Ireland - in reality, how many venues are tech-savvy enough to offer discounts to FourSquare users today? How many in 10 years time? FourSquare might be great if you live in San Francisco but come on - it's just high-tech territorial pissing for everyone else. Nevertheless I'll keep this for now and may actually start 'checking in' for Lunch more often in the hope that some day those Check-ins will be rewarded with a free sandwich or coffee.</p>
<p>Peep. This is a twitter client that comes bundled with the HTC Desire. It's OK. The only other mobile twitter client I've used is Gravity on the Nokia N95 so I don't have a lot of experience. I'm not a heavy twitter user so YMMV.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.loudervoice.com/features/android/">LouderVoice</a>. Lets you easily read and write reviews. I tend to use it for short-form reviews so it's perfect on the HTC Desire. (Must figure out how to integrate it with this blog).</p>
<p>Facebook. Another app that's bundled with the HTC Desire. Can't say I've used it much but you never know - it might come in handy someday.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">What's missing?</span></p>
<p>No Trope. No Bloom. No TonePad. No Daft.ie app. These are sorely missed. Does anyone know of good Android substitutes? There don't seem to be any good piano/synth/generative music Apps at all for Android. Trope and TonePad are two of my favorite iPhone Apps.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Games. </span></p>
<p>These are mostly games for my kids aged 4 and 8. As far as I can tell there are no high quality educational games like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/firstwords-deluxe/id337462979?mt=8">First Words Deluxe</a> for Android phones. This is a real pity. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-holland9-miniclip-qtEz.aspx">Monkey Kick</a> . A simple game my 4 year old loves. Not much to it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-orphanware-saber-xCnp.aspx">Android Light Sabre</a> . Wave the phone around just like Luke Skywalker to make swooshing Light Sabre sounds. It's for my son. Honest.</p>
<p>Teeter. This is a gyro-enabled tilt-the-ball-thru-the-maze game. I'm not sure what the official genre is called but the idea is basically to tilt your phone to guide a ball through a maze avoiding holes. This App comes bundled with the HTC Desire and is surprisingly addictive. The highest compliment - Smooth animation, realistic physics, great gyro sensitivity and haptic feedback combine to make a computer game that's as analog as it gets. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.androidtapp.com/air-control/">Air Control</a> - A clone of Flight Control on the iPhone. Crack addictive. The kind of brilliantly simple game that's only possible with a touch UI. It looks gorgeous on the HTC Desire's high-res screen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-dlinkddns-craig-Ent.aspx">Craigs Race</a>. An old-school top-down racer. Also Crack addictive. Tilt the phone left or right to steer.</p>
<p><a href="http://apps.androidtapp.com/abduction--android-182289/app">Abduction</a> . Another tilt-based game. Gorgeous graphics and fun pick-it-up-and-go gameplay. This is a big hit with my 8yr old daughter and 4yr old son.</p>
<p><a href="http://apps.androidtapp.com/robodefensefree-android-179185/app">Robo Defense</a> . A desktop tower defense clone. If you don't know what Desktop Tower Defense is, then leave my presence (as John Waters would say). This one has gorgeous animated towers and bad guys, and really shows off the HTC Desire's screen. The sounds on this game are great too. Again - it's Crack addictive so approach with extreme caution if you plan on being a productive member of society. </p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p>There are some really good free Apps for Android and after just 2 days I think I've just scratched the surface. While writing this post I discovered <a href="http://www.androidtapp.com/">http://www.androidtapp.com/</a> which seems to be a pretty good Android App review site. After my initial disappointment, I'm really won over. The HTC Desire's big lustrous screen begs to be touched. It's very responsive. The HTC Desire feels slightly lighter than an iPhone but the iPhone feels slightly more comfortable to hold. I can't help but feel the Android MarketPlace could do with a curator. I hope that Google makes paid Apps available in Ireland soon. </p>
<p>Overall I love this phone. I spent a lot of time belly-aching about whether to get a HTC Desire or an iPhone (my wife has an iPhone 3GS) and while initially there were some teething problems (the touch on the HTC Desire felt sloppy at first but that was just me re-learning Touch) I'm glad I chose the HTC Desire instead of the iPhone. </p>
