# Software for One

I was going to write a blog post just like this but James Hague saved me the effort...

Some advice for James; It sounds like he isn't using [Markdown.pl][2] 
but should.  

James' blogging system sounds very like my own. Everything 
is just files, no database involved. It always struck me as overkill to 
use a database for blogging but I suppose once you add comments into the 
mix, it becomes necessary. I'm keenly interested in how blogs are built. 
I realise 99% of blogs are now built using either Wordpress, MovableType 
or hosted on blogger/livejournal etc, but I love reading about the other 
1% who blog using lesser known tools ([blosxom][3], [webmake][4]) or 
home-grown solutions. I have to say I'm pretty happy with the way 
[plain-text blogging][5] has turned out. I've been importing some of the 
posts from my old Xanadb blog I ran from 2002 to 2005 and the blog post 
content isn't pretty - I'm surprised at how much markup I hand-typed. I 
guess Markdown wasn't around then. I still haven't gotten round to 
writing a colophon post explaining how ridiculously simply this blog is 
constructed (I've had too much fun blogging - my blogging output has 
gone way up since I setup this new blog so I must be doing something 
right) but I've been curating [a list of colophon posts][6] I'll use for 
reference when I do.

James' blogging system is the perfect example of Software for One - a 
personal itch that programmers scratch. Some such itches do eventually 
lead to the creation of [Software for Millions (Wordpress)][7] but in 
most cases it's fun just to work on software that has only one user - 
yourself. I first discovered this 24 years ago when I wrote my own 
assembler/disassembler for ZX Spectrum. I did it not because it was 
difficult but because it was easy, fun and a learning experience - oh 
and also because I couldn't afford [Dev-Pac][8] at the time. So, 
Software for One; A fun, easy, learning experience, there are worse ways 
for Programmers to goof off.
