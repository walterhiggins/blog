Its humid. Its late. All the bedroom windows are open but theres no
breeze to offer relief.  I can't get to sleep so I may as well
write...

My mother passed away 8 years ago. It was quite sudden so we never got
a chance to say goodbye.  I really wish she could see our 2 year old
daughter.  Then I would sleep.
