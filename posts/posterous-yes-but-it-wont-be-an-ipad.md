  <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">If version 2 of the iPad has free 3G access, I might be a customer. In the meantime, I'm keeping my eyes peeled for <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/06/icds-tegra-2-powered-gemini-is-the-most-feature-complete-tablet/">ICD's Tegra-2 powered Gemini tablet</a>. It's far more customisable but costs about the same as an iPad. And it does more: it's capable of 1080p video, has a replaceable 40Wh battery, an SD card reader, FM radio, GPS, 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, MicroUSB connectivity to PCs and USB peripherals, stereo speakers, and dual webcams (a 2 megapixel front-facing unit and a 5 megapixel auto focusing snapper on the back). It's multi-touch, runs 3G connections, offers 1,366 x 768 resolution and is Flash compatible.</blockquote>

<p>Halfway through the list of features I found myself glazing over and thinking to myself "Yes... but it's not an iPad." It's just a no-name tablet with lots of features. It doesn't have the cachet - the social capital - of an iPad.</p></div>
