# Swimming Pool
## 2003/09/02 23:00

### Kino Cinema Cork, Saturday August 23rd 2003
#### Dir. François Ozon, France 2003

Billed as an erotically charged suspense/thriller, this is really a
sheep in wolve's clothing. It has a very sunday-evening
sat-down-in-front-of-the-telly feel to it. Think "midsommer-murders"
with tits and you're not far off.  To be fair, it's not all
bad. Charlotte Rampling gets to look cool smoking a joint and nodding
blissfully to french techno music. Then within seconds her cool is
blown when she's forced to dance to the music with a younger
admirer. A cool, funny and memorable scene but not worth the price of
admission.
