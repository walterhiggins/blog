# Welcome to Middle Earth, Cork## 2012/04/01 09:49For April Fool's Day, Google have done something very special and created [8-Bit map tiles for google maps][1]. Anyone who has played Zelda will love it. This is a map of where I live - Ballincollig is slap bang in the center, the 8-bit maps are (sadly) only available at town-level resolution, otherwise I'd be able to see my house and nearby green in glorious 8-bit splendour...![Hyrule - Cork](images/hyrule-cork.png)... Those place names... * Coolatanavally * Faggot Hill * Carriganarra * Mount Desert * Garravagh * Old Quarter * Carrignaveen... They're not made up - though they sound like names dreamt up by J.R.R. Tolkein. One of the cool things about living in Ireland (outside of Dublin) is you look at a map and can pretend you're living in Middle Earth.[1]: http://maps.google.com/?t=8&utm_campaign=8bit&utm_source=yt## CategoriesCartography, Maps, Google, April Fool, Cork
