  <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p> while millions of dollars won't buy you happiness, a job that pays $60,000 a year might help.  This is based on a survey of 600,000 Americans:</p>
<p><strong>"Below 60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get. Above that, we get an absolutely flat line. I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat."</strong></p></blockquote>
