Sometimes I think I'm living in a distopian alternate reality.Â Has anyone at An Bord Pleanala ever watched It's a Wonderful Life or Back to the Future II?
Both films depict distopian alternate histories where things don't work out so well when the villain of the movie (Henry F. Potter and Biff Tannen respectively) gets his way.   Funny how in both movies, a Casino is the worst possible outcome.

In 'Its a wonderful life' a corrupt and venal businessman Henry F. Potter transforms the sleepy white picket fence town of Bedford Falls into the sleazy seedy, casino-strewn PottersVille.

In 'Back to the Future II' a corrupt and venal bully Biff Tannen transforms Hill Valley into a sleazy crime-infested hell-hole, the center of which is a mega-casino called 'Biff Tannen's Pleasure Paradise'.

In Ireland in 2011 a corrupt and venal (the judge's words not mine) politican Michael Lowry plans to transform the sleepy rural town of 'Two Mile Borris' into a entertainment facility at the heart of which will be a super-casino.
Welcome to Ireland 2011.
