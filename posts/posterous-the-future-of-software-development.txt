  <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Regarding Java. I fear that Java will have to be abandoned to the
"Enterprise Development" world. It will be relegated to the hands of
cut-rate business coders bashing out their gray business
applications for $30 / hour. We've passed the tipping point on this
one. We used to joke that Java would be the next COBOL, but that
doesn't seem as funny now that it's true. Java will continue to
exist. Millions of lines of it will be written each year. It won't
be the driver of innovation, though. As individual programmers, I'd
recommend that you learn another language immediately and
differentiate yourself from the hordes of low-skill, low-rent
outsource coders that will service the mainstream Java consumer.</blockquote>

<p>Yikes! :-( Java is how I make my living. Sure I love Perl, JavaScript and have dabbled with Python but Java pays the bills right now.</p></div>
