# www.ros.ie - Broken in so many ways
## 2011/10/18 07:44
The [Irish Tax Office's website][1] is broken in so many ways. First 
there is the requirement that you must use only a Windows PC - sorry Mac 
and Unix users. Their digital certificate system is badly broken. There 
are other, better, easier security systems they could use. This morning 
I got this error when I tried to change my digital certificate location...
    Object doesn't support this property or method
    Line: 156
    Char: 3
    Code: 0
    URI: https://www.ros.ie/ROSCheckerServlet/changeCertDir
Now I have to apply for a new certificate and password which *they will 
send me in the post*.
