It > then neglected Google Reader itself for years, after it had effectively > become the only player. Today it does further damage by buggering up the > already beleaguered links between publishers and readers. It would have > been better for the Internet if Reader had never been at all.  > -- [cortesi - Google, destroyer of ecosystems][1]I reluctantly moved to Reader only when it was apparent that BlogLines was well and truly over. My history of RSS Readers is... 1. AmphetaDesk  2. BlogLines  3. Google Reader... I'm wondering - what next? If I was to be true to the spirit of web self-sufficiency I should self-host. My first thought on hearing that Google Reader was shutting down was "How hard could it be to write your own RSS aggregrator?". Madness - I know - but ...> We&#146;re finally likely to see substantial innovation and competition in > RSS desktop apps and sync platforms for the first time in almost a decade.>  > It may suck in the interim before great alternatives mature and become > widely supported, but in the long run, trust me: this is excellent news.  > -- [Google Reader shutting down July 1 &#150; Marco.org][2][1]: http://corte.si/posts/socialmedia/rip-google-reader.html[2]: http://www.marco.org/2013/03/13/google-reader-sunset## CategoriesGoogle
