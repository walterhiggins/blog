# A Bad Day In Dublin## 2012/02/25 10:59It was sunday evening in June 2004. I was driving west along the Massachusetts Turnpike when I found out former President Reagan had died. An overhead Traffic display displayed this simple message...God speed you President Reagan.... I thought it was odd he was still referred to as 'President', this was more than a decade after he had left office. It was a mark of respect for a former leader. I can't imagine our own former leaders Bertie Ahern or Brian Cowen being afforded the same reverence when they eventually pass on. I was working in Massachusetts at the time and there  were many eulogies for Ronald Reagan in the media. It was odd how Americans perceived him compared to how he was view abroad (in Europe at least) during his terms as president.In early 1983 I was 11 years old (soon to be 12) and the world seemed to be on the brink of nuclear war. There was a long-running stand-off between President Reagan and Soviet leader Brezhnev. The portrayal of Reagan in the media was not kindly. While the russians were still seen as the Bogey-men (this was still the era of the cold war), Reagan was equally terrifying because he was portrayed not so much as a bogey-man but as an old-fogey man - a doddering old Hollywood Ham with his finger on the button that could start world war III. Right or wrong - that's how I remember it at the time.While I was too young to understand the political brinksmanship in play, I did know what Nuclear Bombs were and the devastation they could unleash. The truth is I was equally terrified and fascinated by them. I remember wondering as a child if my family and I would survive if they dropped the bomb on Dublin. We lived in Blanchardstown, at the time a growing suburb on the north-west periphery of Dublin. There was nothing but fields and farmland west of us. That's changed now. Blanchardstown is no longer in 'the sticks' and now has its own suburbs and satellite towns. Blanchardstown is about 6 miles / 9 kilometers from Dublin city center. I liked to imagine that we would be safe from the worst effects of a Nuclear explosion at that distance, but Nuclear bombs come in all sizes so there was no way to be sure. It's fair to say that even though Ireland was not a nuclear power and a highly unlikely target in the case of Nuclear war, the prospect of a nearby Nuclear explosion played heavily on my mind - perhaps because I knew it was such an unlikely scenario, I gave my feverish young imagination free rein. Now we're living in the future, we didn't get nuked but we now have tools to satiate our morbid Nuclear Armageddon Survival fantasies. Enter [nukemap][] and [hydesim][] - The high-yield detonation effects simulator which lets you drop Hypothetical H Bombs anywhere you like. Given my childhood history of preoccupation with nuclear bombs and distance, it's only proper that I dive into what would happen if someone were to drop the H Bomb on Dublin. [Ivy Mike : First H Bomb](http://youtu.be/_D9c9kQDMis) The H Bomb is truly terrifying. It is 500 times more powerful than the Atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The effects of dropping one on Dublin can be seen below.![The Hypothetical H Bomb over Dublin][imgnuke2]That's a whole chunk of the eastern half of the country - and the most densely populated area - wiped out. It would be a very bad day not just for Dublin but for all the Commuting towns too. Notice how closely the inner circle of 100% fatality and devastation hugs the contours of the M50 motorway. Everyone inside the M50 belt dies and all buildings and structures are destroyed. Nothing survives. That's chilling. Beyond that in the blue circle, fatalities are widespread - that's where I lived as a child. So much for Blanchardstown being at a safe remove. People living as far away as Balbriggan, Greystones and Naas would suffer 3rd degree burns and any flammable materials would catch fire. Fires would rage. It is difficult to imagine the scale of devastation and destruction so I'm going to start at Ground Zero.## The Drop Site![Site of the bomb][imgdropsite]Heuston Station. While not exactly in the heart of the city, this site would likely cause the most devastation. Dublin is a coastal city so dropping the bomb bang in the center (say - Temple Bar) would mean much of the effects would radiate out to sea rather than through densely populated areas. Heuston station is just a few miles west of the city center and is situated on the south bank of the river Liffey, just across from the main entrance to the Phoenix park and next to the world-famous Guinness brewery.![Ground Zero][imggz] An above-surface (air burst) detonation would create an instant nuclear fireball of intense heat - tens of millions of degrees. A small Sun 1.5 miles in diameter bursts into existence over the detonation site, instantly vaporizing everything it engulfs - Stoneybatter (N), Dolphin's Barn (S), Kilmainham(W) and The Coombe(E) - changing forever the Geography of Dublin's inner city and suburbs. The crater left behind is many hundreds of feet deep and wide. It would most likely change the course of the river Liffey. Every building and living thing (including the animals in nearby Dubin Zoo) perishes instantly. It would be a quick and merciful death to be engulfed by a Sun. The Nuclear 'Sun' burns briefly before its energy is transformed into kinetic energy and that is when the real carnage begins.![Air Burst][imgairburst]Next comes the blast wave. Traveling at almost twice the speed of sound, the blast wave weakens buildings fractions of seconds before the ensuing blast winds tear them apart. The effects on the human body are devastating, the rapid compression, vacuum and drag, tearing bone from surrounding tissue and rupturing eardrums. Damage to lungs is worst - air embolisms form instantly resulting in fatal hemmorhaging. The effects are felt by everyone within the M50 commuter belt before they perish in the ensuing blast wave. The fatality rate is 100% - half a million people die in the first few seconds after detonation.![Damage within the M50 commuter belt][imgnukem50] The fatalities might be worse were it not for the presence of the Phoenix Park, the largest park in Europe, just a few miles from Dublin city centre. The Phoenix Park is vast. I have walked through it many times and explored its many woods and paths. It is a beautiful place where wild deer roam. It is also - strangely - underutilized by the people of Dublin. I think this is due to a murder which took place there in the early 80s. The park covers 1,752 acres and is the site of Ireland's presidential abode [Aras an Uachtarain][aau], and has played host to summer rock concerts and Papal visits. Growing up, it was on our doorstep, just a short 35 minute walk from home. It has always felt like a magical place to me - strolling through the southern side of the park on saturday evening in summer when games of cricket are being played and walkers are out in force. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47545877@N06/6836501917/" title="Phoenix Park (6) by Derek (Kiwi) Clarke, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7145/6836501917_3c1dcc8cfb.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="Phoenix Park (6)"></a>The phoenix park occupies a large wedge of land within the M50 commuter belt so while lives would be saved, the park itself would be indistinguishable from the surrounding leveled wasteland. Finglas, Beaumont, Sandymount, Rathfarnham, Palmerstown and Castleknock would all be reduced to uniform rubble.Beyond the M50 motorway, damage and fatalities would be far-reaching. The shock wave would be less powerful but still capable of destroying homes. Anyone who looked toward the city would be blinded by the light. Dublin's population has grown considerably in the last 30 years and most of this growth has occurred in the regions beyond the M50 motorway - Blanchardstown, Tallaght and Lucan have seen enormous population growth. These areas would be severely devastated. Most buildings as far as Dunboyne(NW), Malahide(NE), Saggart(SW) and Bray(SE) would be destroyed. Another half a million people would most likely perish. ![Total damage to dublin Urban Area][imgnuke1]The blast wave and heat would continue to emanate 10s of miles from the center resulting in 3rd degree burns on all exposed skin. The heat even at this distance would be so intense that any flammable materials would burst into flames. > When the A-bomb went off we turned our backs put our arms over our eyes, > after a short while we put our goggles on and turned around, what a > sight that was......watching the mushroom cloud. I remember the heat > wave when it hit was like sticking your head in a heated oven.  > -- [Jack B. Green - Operation Sanstone (pdf)][heat]## Ireland's Emergency ResponseI wish I could say we have one. Ten years ago the Irish Government issued every household with a small packet of Iodine Tablets to be used in case of Nuclear Emergency. That is about the sum total our Government has done in preparation for a Nuclear emergency. Ever. Ireland doesn't do 'Emergencies' so it's safe to say the medium-term and long-term aftermath would be worse than anyone can imagine. Over a million people would die, the country's administrative apparatus would be wiped out and tens of thousands would be homeless. It would take an international effort to respond to the ensuing crisis and most likely martial law would be imposed by a foreign state for some time until rule of law could be reinstated.## FootnoteThis is not photoshopped, it is a photo of an actual mushroom cloud caused by an explosion in a gunpowder warehouse near the Four Courts in [Dublin city in June 1922][fcexp1922].
