I'm skeptical about game-creator software. I first tried a game creator 
on the ZX Spectrum in the 80's I can't remember what it was called 
(probably 'Game Creator') but I remember being disappointed. Then a 
couple of years later a friend with an Atari ST showed me a software 
program that could edit sprites and code. He fired up [Bubble Bobble][1] 
then started editing the cute dino sprites and other in-game elements. I 
think that was my first brush with a graphical user interface. It made a 
big impression on me at the time. At $7.99, buying [Codify][2] is a 
no-brainer. I'll try it out and see if the kids like it. It looks like 
fun at the very least.
