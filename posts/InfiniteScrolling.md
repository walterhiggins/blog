# Infinite Scrolling Must Die!
## 2012/03/10 07:26

Last week I caved in and reopened a Google+ account. From my short time 
there I have already learnt one important lesson...

> I believe that every time a developer implements infinite scrolling, a

> worse place.

... Infinite Scrolling Must Die! There is be a special place in hell for 
Developers who think Infinite Scrolling is a good idea; That place is a moving 
walkway - like you see in Airports - whose end is tantalisingly visible but *You* will 
never reach. In Hell, you will walk that Airport walkway forever.

Google+ is one of the worst offenders in using Infinite Scroll Bars in 
its User Interface. When you visit Google Plus, don't even think of 
using the scroll bar; Not only is it infinite, it is also indeterminate. 
You will jump about randomly on the stream while new content loads and 
Google+ tries to guess (incorrectly) where you should have been. I can't 
believe someone in Google HQ looked at this and said "Let's release 
it!". 
 
... And yet ... I just checked [Twitter][]'s front page and it too has 
infinite scrolling but at least its implementation is less annoying. 
Less ... preemptive. Still - I hate infinite scrolling. Go read the [Gem 
Session Rant on Infinite Scrolling][1] - It's a good one. My reasons for 
hating infinite scrolling might be generational - My first exposure to 
Scroll Bars was on the Atari ST, then Windows, then Macintosh System 7. 
I've spent long enough with regular scroll bars to be comfortable with 
them. Don't get me wrong, I can see their utility - I 'get' the 
efficiency of background-requesting smaller chunks of JSON - but I can 
also see how they're a misbehaving hack. A tacked on afterthought. 
Infinite Scroll Bar is the delinquent ADHD child of Buttoned-up Vanilla 
Scroll Bar and every time I drag its handle to the bottom and it 
impudently bounces back up a few notches, I want to slap it. "Stop doing 
that!" I mutter under my breath. Of course, times have changed - you 
can't slap misbehaving anthropomorphized User Interface elements these 
days. I just have to accept infinite scrolling as one of the minor 
annoyances of modern life. If you're interested in how we got here, read 
[the evolution of scroll bars][ev].
