Stallman's Rider. It's all over the internets...

When traveling, Stallman prefers to stay in people's homes rather than 
Hotels. He is something of a hero of mine having given the world Emacs 
among other things, but I'm pretty sure I couldn't meet his exacting 
standards were I to offer him a roof & couch for the night. Even if we 
could meet his exacting demands, as much as I admire the man I don't 
think he'd make a great dinner party guest...

I'm pretty sure the [Apple faithful][2] would disagree but I think this 
is a fitting tribute to Richard Stallman...
