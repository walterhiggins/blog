This was recommended to me by [Mark O'Donohoe][mod] who is a friend
of recently deceased [Artur Kozlowski][hhw]. It's a great read and a terrible
pity that such a good writer (English isn't even his first language)
is gone. This reads like a thriller...

If blog awards are awarded posthumously this should definitely be
nominated.
