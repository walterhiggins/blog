# Terminator 3: T3 
## 2003/07/31 09:00

T3 feels more like a well-framed vignette or humourous side-note, than
another volume in the ongoing Terminator saga.  That's not necessarily
a bad thing.

Firstly, don't watch T2 before watching this - don't even compare the
two films. Fans of T2 probably won't like this movie. T3 has plenty of
self-deprecating humour and is smarter and funnier than I
expected. Much funnier than T2 which come to think of it, wasn't funny
at all.

Arnie gets a bit of a battering in this one, he walks around looking
fatigued and battlescarred, parts of his titanium skull exposed. Whats
really scary is when half his face gets burned off to reveal Charlton
Heston's face underneath. Arnie and Charlton are starting to look
alike in old age. In fight scenes with the she-terminator you almost
expect arnie to utter the immortal words

> Get your hands off of me ... you dirty waif.

T3 - it's the only summer blockbuster showing until the next one comes
along.
