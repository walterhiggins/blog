# Metal Gear Solid

We got a PlayStation 4 for Christmas this year. It was 9 years since we 
last bought a Gaming Console so it was time. I picked up Metal Gear 
Solid V : The Definitive Edition for &#128;27.99 - a steal.

I'm a fan of Stealth games - I _loved_ GoldenEye for the Wii. I'd never 
played any of the Metal Gear Solid series, despite having a PlayStation 
one many years ago. MGS V had been getting great reviews so I gave it a 
shot. So far I've put about 100 hours into the game. Yes. I like this 
game a lot. It is surprisingly deep - a game that for the most part 
rewards slow thoughtful play rather than rushing in all guns blazing. 
Much of the fun of MGS V is to be had simply sneaking up on sites and 
surveying the lay of the land from a safe distance, then picking off 
targets one by one. 

It's been almost 4 months now since I started playing and I still haven't become bored with the game. There is a lot to love about this game but it's not without glaring faults. The story is complete nonsense and the overtly sexualized female companion 'Quiet' is a little troubling. The start of the game consists of - for the most part - an extended cut-scene which involves very little actual game-play. The opening cut-scene is about 45 minutes long and is _painful_. Thankfully, once the game begins proper it's a ton of fun. Each mission has opening and closing credits which remind you that this game was _CREATED AND DIRECTED BY HIDEO KOJIMA_ . This gets a little annoying after you've seen it the umpteenth time.  

If you liked GoldenEye for the Wii, you'll _love_ Metal Gear Solid V. Do yourself a favor - if you've got the Definitive Edition skip the pointless 'Ground Zeroes' and jump straight into 'The Phantom Pain' - it's a completely different feeling game. I feel like there's a lot more I could probably say about MGS V but this will have to do for now.
