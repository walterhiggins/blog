Originally this was called 'Pictures of Sendai'. I wrote it while looking at the [pictures of devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan][1] earlier this year. Warning - those pictures are heart-breaking. I couldn't help thinking of the 1000's of people affected by this. Lives and homes lost. How do you recover? I played this out as I looked at these photos. It is stark and hollow and hopeless. After this track I had to follow up with something that sounded hopeful.
