# How to work comfortably in a state of confusion

I love this quote from an answer to the question [What is it like to have an understanding of very advanced mathematics?][1]...

That is something I've struggled with all my working life as a software engineer moving from project to project in different domains (Retail, Storage, Education, Utilities management, Telecoms, Enterprise Help Desk). I've never truly felt like I spent long enough working in any domain to be expert in it yet as a developer modelling those domains in software I've felt I should be. The above quote offers some solace.
