Some books I've been reading lately...

### Homicide: David Simon

I picked this up for 5 euro in HMV a few weeks back. It's very good. 
Anyone who's watched The Wire knows Simon has a great ear for dialogue 
and this book chronicling a year (1988) he spent with the Baltimore PD 
homicide dept displays the same acute ear for dialogue. If you're a fan 
of The Wire, this is a good read. 

### Venus in Furs: Leopold Von Sacher-Masoch 

This is considered a bit of a classic (it was written in the 1870s) and 
is about a man who enslaves himself to a woman (Masoch unwittingly gave 
his name to Masochism). It's not a great read though it is sometimes 
funny (especially near the end).

### In Praise of Older Women: Stephen Vizinczey 
This one is very good. Wise and Funny in the way of some east-european 
writers. If you've ever read any of Milan Kundera's books and like them, 
you'll probably enjoy this.

### The Third Policeman: Flann O'Brien 
I haven't finished this yet but it is wonderful. I think I love it 
already. Surreal and very funny. 
I've been reading more books lately - actual physical books made of 
paper! - and spending less time online. 

It feels good.
