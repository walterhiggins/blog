# Batman Begins

Just adding my voice to the chorus of praise.

If you haven't see [Batman begins][1] go see it. Tonight! It's hard to
review this film because it's so completely disarming. I can't think
of a single bad thing to say about it, and being a curmudgeonly <a
href="#footnote">wannabe-movie-critic</a>, I've thought long and hard
about something bad to say. The cast is one of those great ensembles
that only comes along maybe once or twice in a decade.

The tone and pacing of the movie is very different to earlier batman
films. It's the kind of movie that doesn't make for a great trailer -
but what a film! No hammy dialogue, no overtly CGI special effects,
none of the usual hollywood trappings of a big budget
movie. Christopher Nolan has made a big budget movie that looks
expensive but hasn't sold out.

After being assailed by the tone-deaf dialog of 'Revenge of the Sith'
it feels good to watch a big budget action flick without
squirming. Batman Begins is pitch perfect throughout. Great dialog (OK
some dialog is delivered in that 'full of portent' style, but this is
after all a batman movie - the batman origin movie), great cast, great
set (Gotham city never looked better or seedier) and some great
action. Nolan has made the superhero origin<a href="#origin">#</a>
movie par excellence. This is the film Unbreakable wishes it could
be. 

<a name="footnote">1.</a> Movie reviews have been non-existent around
these parts thanks largely to reading and then re-reading Anthony
Lane's "Nobodys Perfect". Lane puts amateurs like me and people who
get paid to write reheated press-kit to shame.

<a name="origin">2.</a> Isn't the superhero origin story the only
superhero story really worth telling ? Come on, which would you rather
see, Superhero X duking it out with SuperVillan Y smashing up
SuperCity Z in the process, or how SuperHero X came to be who he is. I
guess if your under 12 years old, the answer will be the former, but
for perennial geeks, origin stories are a favourite.
