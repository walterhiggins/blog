Punch Drunk Love is a departure in style for director Paul Thomas
Anderson in that it attempts to depict the inner-life of its
protagonist.  Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan - an awkward and agitated
loveless bachelor who runs his own business from a low-rent unit in
some unnamed industrial hinterland.
The film opens with Egan talking on the phone about air-mile coupons.
Its the tail-end of the conversation, he puts down the phone and the
camera pans out to reveal a barren whitewashed industrial unit, the
desk and chair are the only furniture in the large cavernous
space. The soundtrack is of distant traffic, creaking metal hulls and
the sound of an aircraft passing overhead at 4am in the morning, they
are the sounds of anxiety. Before we know anything about Egan's wordly
circumstances we know his state of mind.
PTA has an impeccable ear for music in his movies but here he eschews
pop and rock completely for a cacophony of barely audible background
noise and what I can only call 'agit-jazz' (note to self: check if the
term 'agit-jazz' hasn't already been coined). Paul Thomas Anderson
uses sound in this movie much like Terence Davies does in [The long
day closes][1] - to describe the inner life - the wordless void of
feelings and thoughts that lie just beneath the threshold of
expression.  What he is in effect doing is telling two stories
simultaneously.
Where the off-beat soundtrack succeeds in expressing Egan's peculiarly
agitated state of mind, PTA occasionally resorts to visual metaphors -
two psychedelic sequences - which frankly could have been cut. PTA
seems to be using his license as an auteur by throwing everything at
the celluloid canvas and seeing what sticks. Not everything - but I
suspect thats the point.  There are a few red herrings in the movie,
introduced I suspect perhaps out of boredom, perhaps to keep the flow
of the movie. But these are minor quibbles, Anderson the story-teller
is - even in this offbeat oddly paced film - better than most other
directors working today.
Sandler is perfect in this role as is Emily Watson, much is often made
of 'chemistry' between the leads in a romance. Fuck 'chemistry', this
is a movie about love - not lust.  It's apparent from the moment they
meet that they only have eyes for each other. Its also apparent in
their quirky but oddly affecting pillow talk...
    > Egan: I see your face ... and I wanna smash it in ... its so
    > goddamn pretty 
	 > Lena: I want to scoop your eyeballs out with a
    > spoon
Just when you think you're watching a lighthearted oddball romantic
comedy things happen in this movie that change your body chemistry. In
one scene I felt a sudden sickening rush of adrenaline.  I swear it
must be the soundtrack - something subliminal anyway because it took
me by surprise.  There are very few movies that make you care (at the
gut level) about what happens to the characters and fewer still that
can evoke a sense of peril and danger.
This is one such movie.
