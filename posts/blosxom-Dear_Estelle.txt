# Dear Estelle...

I rather like your new 'Shine' album. It is chock full of loveliness but 
I have some reservations about the language used on certain tracks. 

Please note that the use of the following words...

1. Piss
2. Bitch
3. Fuck
4. Ho

... are words ill-fitting to a nice young woman of your standing. I 
trust you will endeavour to be more mindful of your language in 
forthcoming releases, of which I am looking forward to.

Yours Sincerely.
