[Ulrich Schnauss: Between us and them](http://youtu.be/o-1kYIxstqI)
Ulrich Schnauss's 'Between us and them' always seems to put me
in 'The Zone'. It takes a while to get going but slowly builds up to a
propulsive euphoric high that gets the blood rushing through your
veins. At the same time it's not _Loud_ music. It's not to everyone's
taste and probably sounds a little dated (I imagine it sounded dated
when it was released in 2001 - the music snob in me hates it but I
keep coming back to it). It nestles in that nowhere land between
background music and music you actively listen to. I think that's what
makes it good for putting me in _The Zone_.

If music can increase flow of blood through your veins and through
your head then that's got to have some positive cognitive effects
right?

There's that word again. *Flow*. It's a delicate balancing act but the
type of music that seems to put me in the zone is Electronica -
something propulsive but not loud. So far (from my unscientific
research on myself) it seems the effects are short-lived - kind of
like how you feel after 1 or 2 cups of coffee.
