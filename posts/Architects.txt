They pick up the > hammers and nails and work along side those workers, showing them how > it&#146;s done, building the thing together, and making those around them > better until it is no longer a fungible collection of workers, but a > humming, autonomous machine that&#146;s more than the sum of its parts.  > -- [Uber-Architects: The Building Metaphor Is Dead | DaedTech][1][1]: http://www.daedtech.com/uber-architects-the-building-metaphor-is-dead## CategoriesSoftware, Programming
