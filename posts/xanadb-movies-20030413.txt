Autofocus tells the story of [Bob crane][1], star of [Hogan's
Heroes][2] and his descent from A-List tv star and family man to a
Z-list dinner theatre actor and pornographer. You know how this is
going to turn out so everything is in the telling of the tale. Bob was
obsessed with 3 things, Fame, Pornography and Technology. (Fame and
Technology both being enablers of his one true love: Porn). Bob would
have loved the Internet.

[Greg Kinnear][3] gives a great performance as Bob Crane, it may be a
monotone performance but there is plenty of nuance in this
happy-go-lucky persona.  Bob likes Pornography, he keeps magazines in
his garage and half-heartedly agrees to throw them out when his wife
discovers them.  His interest takes on a life of its own when he meets
fellow-pornographer and tech whizz [Willem Dafoe][4]'s John Carpenter
and the two embark on a slide into the sleazier side of hollywood
life. Bob gets the girls, John gets the footage. The two become
co-dependant.  The relationship between the two lead actors is what
this movie is all about. Wifes come and go ('Bob - you're never home'
- becomes a mantra for successive wifes) and the female parts seem
underwritten. Which is a great pity because some of the ripest scenes
are the confrontations between Bob and his first wife.

Autofocus looks and feels 2 stops overexposed.  Outdoor scenes looked
washed out, colors bleed into one another.  You can only guess what
colour suits the actors are wearing.  Interior scenes look soft and
grainy.  That said, there isn't a soft-focus filter that can rub out
Willem Dafoe's face.

Dafoe comes across like the offspring of a pairing between John Waters
and Gollum from 'The two towers'. Dafoe's bunny girl impression and
his desparate neediness of Bobs friendship are some of the most
memorable scenes from the movie. There's a striking similarity with
gollum, beseeching eyes, grey lifeless skin tone, a thin film of
spittle on the upper lip. Dafoe *is* Gollum !  Dafoe's acting is all
in his face, those beautiful creases bearing testimony to a lifetime
of sleaze.

Emotionally, the movie is overexposed too.  Early scenes between Bob
and his wife and family resonate because of Bob's half assed attempts
to hide his porn collection, and his pat dismissal when they are
discovered.  When he takes home a handheld video camera and sits
watching family home movies with his wife and kids, you can see the
light dancing in his eyes while his wife watches him leerily - this is
cinema gold.  The best scenes are when Bob is confronted about his
lifestyle, by his wife, his agent, and when his porn-obsessed
world-view clashes embarassingly with mainstream TV people, throwing
it into sharp relief.  However for much of the movie, we are presented
with a non-judgemental first person account of the sleazier side of
celebrity life in 60's and 70's hollywood.  While Dafoe is great on
screen, a little less screen-time for dafoe and a little more for
[Rita Wilson][5] (Anne Crane - Bob's first wife) might have made for a
more interesting movie.
