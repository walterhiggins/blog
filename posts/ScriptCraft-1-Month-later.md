# Anatomy of a ScriptCraft Plugin## 2013/01/23 00:58So this christmas project... it's grown legs. I've been working on [ScriptCraft][sc] late most nights and haven't really had a chance to talk about what I've done so here goes....ScriptCraft has evolved a little from it's early MCP-only incarnation where you could only use it for building stuff in minecraft, into something much more. I've switched from MCP (Minecraft Coder Pack) to Bukkit because bukkit has a sane API and the bukkit guys have been hired by Mojang to work on the upcoming official plugin API so chances are there won't be too much breakage for existing bukkit plugins. The remit of ScriptCraft has expanded so that you can do more than just build - you can do anything you like - Custom Event handling, mini-games, interactive/dynamic signs, easy signage (text written using minecraft blocks), - anything you can do using a java-based plugin, you can do it faster and easier in Javascript with the ScriptCraft plugin. To demonstrate this, I've recreated a commonly-used mod (homes) in javascript. The `homes` javascript plugin lets players set their current location as home and return to that location using in-game commands. They can also visit other players' homes. It's a simple plugin that demonstrates a couple of new features in ScriptCraft ... * Persistence * Adding Player (non-operator) commands... First persistence. Persistence is the ability to retain state after the server has shutdown and started up again. Persistence is something you get for free if you create your javsacript plugin using the new `plugin()` function provided with ScriptCraft - just keep any data you want to save in a property called `store` and that data will be written and read at shutdown and startup. The data is persisted in JSON form so it's even somewhat human-readable. Declaring a new plugin is easy, you give your plugin a name, specify an interface/object and whether the plugin should be persistent. For this I'm going to create a new plugin called "chat" that will let players change the default color of their messages in the in-game chat window...    plugin("chat", {         setColor: function(player,chatColor) {             this.store.players[player.name] = chatColor;        }    }, true);    // initialize the store     chat.store.players = chat.store.players || {};The above code doesn't do a whole lot other than let operators set a player's color choice ( `/js chat.setColor(__self, "green")` ). A little bit more code has to be added so that the player's text color will change when chatting with other players, but the above code will ensure the player's color setting is at least saved. The following code just ensures that when a player chats , the text will be displayed in their chosen color...    ready(function()    {        var colors = ["black", "blue", "darkgreen", "darkaqua", "darkred",                      "purple", "gold", "gray", "darkgray", "indigo",                      "brightgreen", "aqua", "red", "pink",                      "yellow", "white"];        var colorCodes = {};        for (var i =0;i < colors.length;i++) colorCodes[colors[i]] = i.toString(16);                events.on("player.AsyncPlayerChatEvent",function(l,e){            var player = e.player;            var playerChatColor = chat.store.players[player.name];            if (playerChatColor){                e.message = "&sect;" + colorCodes[playerChatColor] + e.message;            }        });    });        The `ready()` function takes a callback and ensures that the function supplied will not be invoked until all of the javascript functions have loaded. It declares a lookup table of colors / names and adds an event handler which intercepts and inserts color codes into player's text messages. The `events.on()` function comes courtesy of the `events` plugin so that's why event handlers for a plugin should usually only be loaded inside a `ready()` callback.The other new addition to ScriptCraft is the `/jsp` command - this lets operators expose plugins for use by regular players. To be clear, `/jsp` does not do any javascript evaluation, it just accepts parameters which are then passed on to the appropriate javascript plugin. So far in this example plugin we haven't provided any way for regular players to - you know - actually set their text color of choice - only operators can do this for a player using the `js chat.setColor(...)` javascript statement. Let's be clear - giving your players access to the whole API via javascript isn't a good idea. So how do you safely let players choose their text color? If you've written a javascript function and want players to be able to use that function, you expose it using the new `command()` function like so...    command("chat_color",function(params){        var color = params[0];        if (colorCodes[color]){            chat.setColor(__self,color);        }else{            __self.sendMessage(color + " is not a valid color");            __self.sendMessage("valid colors: " + colors.join(", "));        }    },colors);... The above code adds a new *subcommand* to the `/jsp` command and also specifies autocomplete options (the last parameter - `colors`) for that command when the player presses the `TAB` key. Now the player themselves can change their chosen chat color like so...    /jsp chat_color yellow... What I've done here is create a new plugin which lets players choose a chat color and saves that preference when the server shuts down and starts up. I've also added a new `jsp` sub-command - `chat_color` that players use to change their chat color setting. The full plugin source code is just a couple of lines of code but is a fully working plugin...    // declare a new javascript plugin    plugin("chat", {        setColor: function(player, color){            this.store.players[player.name] = color;        }    },true);    // initialize store    chat.store.players = chat.store.players || {};    // when the 'events' module is ready ...    ready(function()    {        var colors = ["black", "blue", "darkgreen", "darkaqua", "darkred",                      "purple", "gold", "gray", "darkgray", "indigo",                      "brightgreen", "aqua", "red", "pink",                      "yellow", "white"];        var colorCodes = {};        for (var i =0;i < colors.length;i++) colorCodes[colors[i]] = i.toString(16);                events.on("player.AsyncPlayerChatEvent",function(l,e){            var player = e.player;            var playerChatColor = chat.store.players[player.name];            if (playerChatColor){                e.message = "&sect;" + colorCodes[playerChatColor] + e.message;            }        });        command("chat_color",function(params){            var color = params[0];            if (colorCodes[color]){                chat.setColor(__self,color);            }else{                __self.sendMessage(color + " is not a valid color");                __self.sendMessage(colors.join(","));            }        },colors);    });    ![Chat Color plugin][1]... this is what I would call a minimum viable plugin and it demonstrates some of the new features of ScriptCraft - persistence (automatic) , event handling, and exposing new functionality to players using the `/jsp` command. I hope this will give potential MineCraft modders a feel for just how easy it can be to change the game to suit their needs. I have a lot of things I want to do with and using ScriptCraft, but I also want to circle back to the educational side and spend some more time working on the Young Person's Guide to programming in Minecraft. If you've read this far, I hope you've found it helpful.You can [download the ScriptCraft Plugin here][dl].[1]: images/scriptcraft-chat-color.png[sc]: http://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/[dl]: files/scriptcraft/## CategoriesScriptCraft, Minecraft
