# Conversation Happens Elsewhere

This tweet from Conor gave me something to think about...

That [link][1] is to a 22 comment thread on facebook about how I 
organise my socks. Who knew [15 pairs of identical grey socks][2] could 
be such a conversation starter? Because I'm not active on Facebook I 
wouldn't even have known about this if Conor hadn't told me. This blog 
doesn't support comments and never will - it's just not worth the 
headache, Spam, Anonymous abuse. At one point I was going to write a 
blog post on why I won't ever support in-house comments but [James Hague 
beat me to the punch][6]. However, Facebook solves most of these 
problems. A lot of the people in that comment thread are people I know 
and meet occasionally. Look at the comments too - they're funny, 
informative - not your typical blog comment thread. A couple of thoughts...
1. More than anything this makes me think I might be missing out by 
turning my back on Facebook. I have an account but culled my friends 
from 150+ to less than 10 (people who are facebook-bound - I have no 
other way to contact them). Facebook just wasn't very useful with that 
many friends. There is value in Facebook but it's bloody hard to see it 
with all the noise.
2. I am under no illusion here. Conor is a more social and sociable 
networker than I. It may have been my content that triggered it but the 
conversation happened around Conor's status update. Had I posted the 
story on Facebook with my old facebook network, I doubt it would have 
garnered as much attention or conversation. 
3. I'm willing to give Facebook comments a trial run on this blog. This 
runs counter to pretty much everything I've been writing about these 
past months. Especially my [Back To Basics][3] and most recently (ahem - 
yesterday) [We Don't Need No Stinking Widgets][4]. Facebook have made it 
easy to add facebook comments to a website but just because I *can* do 
something, it doesn't mean I *should*. 
4. I appreciate the heads up from [Conor][5] but I think those comments 
*do* belong on Facebook. I might have brought the 15 pairs of grey socks 
to the party but Facebook provided the social lubricant that got people 
talking about them. If those comments belong anywhere, it's on Facebook. 
I don't have the time to manage comments here and I'm OK (more than OK 
actually) that people read the blog post and commented somewhere else. 
At least with the newly installed Facebook comment widget [cough] 
there's a focal point for conversation. 
5. This could be a slippery slope. Just the other day I ragged on
BroadSheet about the [social media clutter on their blog][7]. Adding
the Facebook Comments to each page here adds 240K and 11 extra HTTP
requests to each page load. That's significantly more than data than
most of my posts. Is it worth the extra page load time? We'll see.
I'll see how this goes - it might well be that the post on how I
organise my sock drawer is as interesting as it gets around here ;-)
