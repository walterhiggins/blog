# iTunes breaks everything it touches
## 2011/10/26 23:11
iTunes isn't just broken, it breaks everything it touches. I updated
two devices to iOS 5 this weekend. One update (my iPad) went swimmingly, the
other (my wife's iPhone) resulted in lost Apps and (more importantly) lost
contacts. Apple have some serious User Experience problems in iTunes
that need fixing.
iTunes terrifies me. As it should. Any application which has the power
to wipe out $$$ worth of software and carefully curated contacts
should scare you. I don't know what others experience with iTunes has
been but mine has been terrible. I've been using iTunes since 2005 -
first on a Windows PC, then an iBook and most recently on a Macbook
Pro. Over the years, iTunes has grown increasingly hostile to
users. Last weekend it wiped out 18 months of Apps and contacts on my
wife's iPhone. The loss of apps didn't bother her so much as the loss
of all her contacts. This is how it happened...
On saturday I had some time to spare so I decided to upgrade my iPad
to the shiny new iOS 5 operating system. I plugged in my iPad and
started up iTunes (this is something I don't often do because iTunes
scares me). I clicked the 'Update' button. After a series of
confusingly worded dialogs (seriously - someone needs to review the
copy on these dialogs) I gathered that iTunes backed up my iPad and
installed the update. It then restored the iPad from the backup. I
disconnected the iPad and checked that everything was as before - no
missing apps or app files (all my garageband songs were still there).
Confident that the update would be OK, I went ahead and decided to
update my wife's iPhone. Again, iTunes indicated that it was
performing a backup of the phone before updating. It updated the phone
but when I disconnected, all the apps and contacts were gone. When I
reconnected the phone, there was no backup to restore to! The only
backup listed was for my own iPad.
Needless to say I was not happy. My wife was not happy. The contacts
on her phone were gathered over a period of 18 months - they included
numbers for parents of our son's classmates, our kid's childminder,
violin teacher etc - you get the picture. My wife is the networker -
her phone contacts are far more valuable than mine. Losing them is a
big fecking deal. 
So now we have an iPhone 3GS running iOS 5 but with no apps or
contacts - it's pretty much factory default. *I feel terrible about
this because it was my idea to update the phone but you know who
should feel worse ? Apple's iTunes team. You guys seriously fucked
up*. How can iTunes perform a backup of an iPhone then lose that
backup? Aren't you guys supposed to make this easy to use for regular
people? Isn't that the whole point of the iTunes walled garden? - To
protect our devices and the content therein?
Leaving aside the major problem here (which is that iTunes does not
see the iPhone backup it performed), did you know you can perform a
backup of your iPad or iPhone without having to update the OS? I did
not know this. The reason I did not know this is because the 'Backup'
and 'Restore' actions are not visible in the iTunes interface. There
is a 'Sync' button but no 'Backup' button. Is Sync the same as Backup?
In the absence of a Backup button I would think it is. It turns out
you *can* backup your iPhone by holding down the Control key and
clicking on the device in iTunes and choosing 'Backup' from the
drop-down menu. I did not know this because it is not immediately
apparent in the iTunes interface. It should be. Backup and Restore
should be front and center in the iTunes UI. Are Apple afraid to do
this because it would muddy the waters and lead to confusion regarding
'Sync'? What's the difference between 'Backup' and 'Sync' - I don't
know but that's something for the iTunes team to figure out and
simplify. 
In the meantime, if anyone knows how I can get my old iPhone content
back please [contact me on twitter][1].
