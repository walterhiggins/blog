It's a great book.<object height="425" width="425"> <param name="movie" value="https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1977517&auto_play=false&player_type=artwork&color=ff7700"></param> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess="always" height="425" src="https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1977517&auto_play=false&player_type=artwork&color=ff7700" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425"></embed> </object>   The music itself is a mixed bag.
