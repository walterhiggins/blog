Sound advice. 

It got me thinking. The advice is just as applicable to individuals
too, but harder to follow because most Facebook and Twitter denizens
don't have the resources or know-how available to a company, to establish their
own presence outside the walled gardens.

For those of us who do have that luxury, we have a duty to make it
easier for people to own their own Mothership. To make owning and
managing your own content and identity as easy as possible.

## The Juice

Why should ordinary Facebook & Twitter denizens care about owning
their own content, identity and friends list? Because they are Chattel 
[unwittingly being sold][8], every day *by each other* to companies and
brands vying for their attention. That slightly icky feeling you get
each time a Facebook app or survey/prize-draw asks for your profile
(and friends) information just so you can be in with a chance to win
something? That's the insidious all-pervading attention-grab. The
'Juice' that Robert Scoble refers to is the fluid communication and
interaction he sees on Google+ and Facebook, compared to his blog. The
reality is you and your friends are the juice that's powering Facebook/Google+.

OK. That analogy might be a little OTT but you get [my meaning][9] :-)  
Owning your own mothership means owning your own content, identity and
list of friends. Facebook, Twitter, Google+ - These are all
'Motherships' - your online interactions (Status updates, Comments, Likes, Retweets, G+ Shares)
are all beamed back to the respective Motherships all the better to
advertise to you. In the 2000s, your 'Mothership' was your blog. In the
future it will have to be more than that. [OpenID][4] (Identity management)
is a step in the right direction but it's too bloody difficult even for programmers,
never mind regular people. There are a couple of [noble-but-nerdy][6]
efforts underway but it's going to take time and [not everyone wants to
be saved][3]. 

## What can we Noble Nerds do?

Asking your Facebook-bound Aunt to go cold-turkey on Facebook isn't
going to work. It takes small steps to ween regular people off of
Facebook/G+. Wait, that's not really what I meant either. Like John
Batelle, I don't believe in turning your back completely on the big 3
(Facebook/Twitter/G+), but there are better ways to use these
services. I think your blog should be your first port of call if
you've something to say that takes more than 140 characters. I think
you _can_ use Facebook without selling out your friends (Now *that*
would be a good talk - "How to use Facebook without Selling out your
Friends"). So here's a short list of things we can do to help our
Facebook or G+ bound friends...

  1. Help them setup a [blog][5]. (Hosted on their own or your server is preferable)
  2. [Run an OpenID identity server for them][4] on your server.  

It's a short list right now because the whole friends-list management thing?
- That's difficult to do in a distributed way that makes sense to
humans.  The other thorny problem is 'Comments'. Right now my comments
are managed by the [Disqus Mothership][7] and ideally I'd like if this
too could be distributed so that everyone owns their own
comments. It's another thing we haven't figured out yet. Owning
your own content is a start, we need to get to work figuring out what
the new citizen-owned Motherships will look like and how they will
communicate with the millions of other Motherships.
