# Otherwise-interesting People
## 2012/02/21 13:06
My [FourSquare Rant][1] caused a bit of a stir. There was the 
predictable 'Just use Filters' push back (which itself is a tacit 
admission that 4sq cross-posting is polluting the stream), but one 
interesting response which I can't tackle using Twitter was this one by 
[Stewart Curry][2].

Twitter is great but debating the finer points of twitter etiquette 
requires out-of-band communication which is why I'm responding here. The 
implication is that I've no right to complain about 4sq tweeting friends 
because I've explicitly subscribed to them and therefore must take the 
bad with the good. Also implied (correct me if I'm wrong Stewart) is 
that if I don't like my friend's behaviour I should just unfollow. The 
problem with that is these 4sq tweeters are - aside from their 4sq 
tweeting - **really interesting people**. I'm *already* very selective 
about who I follow, which is why it pains me so much that some of these 
people have such bad habits ;-). Unfollowing them would be like no 
longer inviting friends around just because their aim in the bathroom is 
off. Is it verboten to gently cajole your friends' online behaviour? Is 
there no room for gentle criticism? To say "Hey FourSquare Jocks, stop 
spraying your 4sq mayorship spoor all over my twitter bathroom!" seems 
perfectly fine to me.
It's a curious line of thinking that says we must accept a person for 
all they are - XBox Live achievements, GetGlue TV watching habits, and 
4sq jockeying included - or not at all. I'd like Stewart to elaborate 
[on in his blog][3]. Personally, I'm not yet ready to give up on my 
friends while they can still be redeemed ;-)
Update: Stewart responds...

We'll have to agree to disagree but teasing this out in anything other 
than long-form blog posts would have been frustrating. Much as I love 
twitter, it's not the best forum for teasing out the subtleties of 
twitter etiquette. There's something to be said for both points of view.
