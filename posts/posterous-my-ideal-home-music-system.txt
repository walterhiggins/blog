# My ideal home music system

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Disclaimer: What you are about to read may be completely idiotic for one of two reasons...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[1] It makes no sense and is founded on a poor understanding of music streaming and the current technology used by today's home music hardware.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[2] It is already possible and has been for at least 5 to 10 years, but I just don't know about it - thus proving my complete lack of knowledge in this area.</p>
<p>The last music hi-fi system (are they even still called that?) I bought was a Sony 5-CD changer system with a tape-deck and 2 speakers. I bought it in 1998.</p>
<p>I haven't bought a new music system since but would like to get one - preferably one that plays MP3s.</p>
<p>Ideally I'd like something small and unobtrusive that still has some oomph.</p>
<p>Ideally I'd like the system to be able to play MP3 music which it receives 'over-the-air'.</p>
<p>Ideally I'd like to use my android phone as a remote control - i.e. use it to pick music.</p>
<p>Ideally I'd like to be able to broadcast music already on my android phone to the music system. In effect the android device would be both the music repository and the remote control.</p>
<p>Essentially what I would like is to be able to stream my music from one device (my phone) to another (a speaker) within the comfort of my own home.  </p>
<p>Is this possible - and if so, where can I buy the hardware (music system) and software (streaming app for Android phone) ?</p>
<p>Please leave comments.</p>
