In the early 80s ( I was 10 or 11 ) I had a book - 'Science Fact & 
Science Fiction' I think it was called - which had a comic strip in it 
called 'Jason January, Space Cadet'. Even then (the 80s) the story 
seemed like it was from another era peopled as it was by 'rotters' and 
'scoundrels' and other provincial english stereotypes. A better name for 
it would be 'Little Englanders in Space'. Here's a taste of what it was about...

... What jogged my memory about Jason January was Paul Verhoeven's 
Starship Troopers (it's on BBC tonight). While Starship Troopers is 
obviously satire, it's difficult to tell if the writer of Jason January 
had tongue planted firmly in cheek. It definitely belongs to a bygone 
era.
