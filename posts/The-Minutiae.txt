I withdrew from Facebook, FourSquare andGoogle Plus. Facebook overwhelmed me. I was friends with 150 people atone time and now it's just 9. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't handlethe minutiae of other people's lives. Joe posted a status update. Jackcommented on Joe's status update. Jill likes Jack's comment on Joe'sstatus update. On and on. It didn't help that 'Joe', 'Jack' & 'Jill'(not their real names) were only acquaintances and their freneticFacebook activity buried updates from closer less-frenetic friends. Iwrestled with Facebook's display settings but eventually just said"Fuck it!" and culled the list of friends down to a manageable 9 (allof which are facebook-bound - I have no other way to contact them). Itfelt good, but the minutiae of other people's lives is ever present. I[hated on 4sq recently][2] because that is a perfect example ofmeaningless minutiae that is prevalent on Twitter. Other details ofother people's lives I have no interest in include... * How many miles so-and-so jogged. * How many calories so-and-so burned today. * Where so-and-so had lunch. * Which airport so-and-so just arrived at. * Which game 'Achievement' so-and-so just completed in XBox Live.  * Which TV show so-and-so has just begun watching. My problem with all of the above is that none of them are creativeactivities. It's all about consumption and taste. I don't hate 4sq perse, I hate what it represents; the logical endpoint in the trendtowards sharing the minutiae of our lives. The urge to share theminute details is strong because it is a substitute for actual realcreativity. Sharing tastes - the books we read, the TV shows we like,our favourite Albums - on social networks offers the illusion ofcreativity without requiring any creative effort. 4sq doesn't evenpretend to offer this illusion - it is a simple statement of the Id "Iam here" which is the least interesting thing any human being cansay. Facebook's appeal is that it lets me curate a museum of theself. Photos, status updates - over time - begin to feel like a kindof creative endeavour and the urge to create or at least feel creativeis strong. The minutiae add up - which is why some people like to beable to back up their facebook and twitter data. I've never wanted toback up my twitter data (9,000+ tweets over 5+ years) because it's notworth it. Those tweets are gone - I'm not Oscar Wilde - there'snothing worth salvaging there.This lack of interest in the minutiae of other people's lives marks meas some kind of autistic misanthrope in certain circles. But I amkeenly interested in other people's creative endeavours. Most of thepeople I follow on Twitter are creative people, Writers, Programmers,Designers, Entrepreneurs & Artists with big things going on in thebackground; [Magazines][], [Businesses][]. We're all new here. Testingthe boundaries of what's interesting to others. I hope sharing theminutiae is a short-term abberation but I suspect it isn't. TheTechnology to share every minute detail of our daily existence is nowavailable and by god we're going to use it whether it bores you ornot. [1]: http://www.joeydevilla.com/2008/08/08/why-the-lucky-stiff-on-why-you-should-create/[2]: Tweeting-In-Absentia.html[Magazines]: http://readidea.com[Businesses]: http://loudervoice.com## CategoriesCurmudgeonry
