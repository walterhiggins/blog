The problem with occasional sarcasm...

... is that ...

> @antgalvin Thanks. Not a theme. The blog is home-brew. I'm too much of a geek to resist writing my own blogging software.

... no one knows when you're being earnest

> @walter re Theme, was meant to be a joke, now I'm not sure if you're out sarcasming me. Nice work BTW.

I would link to the Father Ted episode where Father Jessup (The world's 
most sarcastic priest) falls foul of his own sarcasm but I can't find it
