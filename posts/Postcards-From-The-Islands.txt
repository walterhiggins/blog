# Postcards From The Islands

## 2012/02/09 05:14

This is part 2 of a 3 part series on blogging & social networks. 
Part One: [Bridging The Archipelago][pt1]. Part Three: [Own Your Own Mothership][pt3].
Take a deep breath. Now exhale. This is going to get personal.

I've been thinking some more about this [ongoing tension][3] between 
social networks (specifically - Facebook) and the rest of the web 
(specifically - Blogging). In my last post on the subject -[Bridging The 
Archipelago][1] - there was a hint of angst, a lament that blogs and 
bloggers weren't as connected as people on Facebook are. The inference 
being that blogs should perhaps be more like Facebook. The same 
insecurities are evident in other [articles][4] on the web about 
Facebook and the slow [demise][5] of Blogging. I've been framing this 
the wrong way - Facebook and Blogging are not in opposition and Blogging 
is not inferior to Facebook.

An optimistic point of view would be that Twitter and Facebook are 
gateway drugs to longer, more thoughtful forms of self-expression but 
that hasn't happened. Why is that?

## Blogging is Hard

Blogs _are_ less connected than Facebook. They also require more work 
and more thought. There's also the self-consciousness which every virgin 
blogger must get over. Twitter and Facebook deftly side-stepped this 
problem by limiting what you could say to just a handful of words. When 
you sit down in front of Twitter or Facebook, you're not staring into 
the gaping maw of a blank screen. There is a buffet of high-carb sugary 
status updates for the mind. Adding your own bon mots to the mix is 
easy. Updates are real-time too. There is a comforting and addictive 
immediacy to Facebook & Twitter that encourages snacking on these 
low-fibre news portions throughout the day. Add to this the 
connectedness felt when someone 'likes' or comments on something you 
posted and it's easy to see why more people spend time on Facebook than blogging.

## Blogging is Slow

The pace of blog updates is less frenetic than Facebook. Life is slower 
in the Blogging Archipelago. Aside from sweat-shop blogs like the 
Huffington Post, Mashable and TechCrunch, personal blogs have been 
updating at the same pace since 2003. That's not such a bad thing. In 
fact that's something worth celebrating. What has to date been seen as a 
weakness could be one of Blogging's strengths. Rather than standing 
outside of Facebook & Twitter, looking in and wondering why people 
aren't out here blogging, we should work from the inside, carving holes 
in the walls offering glimpses of what life is like outside the walled 
gardens. Instead of trying to be more connected and real-time, treat our 
blog posts like postcards we send to our friends on Facebook and 
Twitter. A glimpse of what life is like on the Blogging Archipelago. 
Postcards from the Isands.

This recent post on Salon's blog talks about how they've slowed down the 
pace of blogging and now have more readers than ever...

> We've also -- completely against the trend -- slowed down our process. 
> We've tried to work longer on stories for greater impact, and publish 
> fewer quick-takes that we know you can consume elsewhere. We're actually 
> publishing, on average, roughly one-third fewer posts on Salon than we 
> were a year ago (from 848 to 572 in December; 943 to 602 in January). 
> So: 33 percent fewer posts; 40 percent greater traffic.  
> -- [Salon ~ Hit record][2]

... 600 blog posts a month. That's still a hell of a lot of posts even 
for a large group blog. I only mention this because I hope it's 
indicative of a trend towards slower, more thoughtful writing on the web 
because - frankly - looking at Facebook and Twitter can - at times - be 
fucking exhausting. 

## Blogging is Empowering

This is my Blog. Everything on this page - the words, the colors, font 
size, font type, and line height - was fussed and fretted over, by me, 
so that it would be readable, by you. I made this. Not Facebook. Not 
Twitter. I have complete control. That's just _one_ of the benefits of 
being a blogger.

## Blogging is Easy

If you have a personal weblog, you are in a uniquely privileged 
position. You can write what you like, when you like, and anyone with an 
internet connection (half the planet) can read it. *This is the stuff of 
science fiction*. Stop comparing yourself to the latest "successful" 
blogger who just got a book deal. This isn't about a book deal. *This* 
is the end game. Self Expression, not Self Promotion. You have thoughts, 
things to say that can't be said in 140 characters or don't belong on 
Facebook. That book you've just started reading - what are your first 
impressions? The computer game you just played, was it good? bad? - why 
was that? A walk by the river on an autumn afternoon or a song or 
snippet of conversation leads to a train of thought that leads to a 
Revery. What was that like? Where will you go with that once you start 
putting words to screen? 

## Blogging is Personal

Some of you might have tried blogging a couple of years ago, felt 
self-conscious about it and gave up. Maybe it's time to [give it another 
go][6]. To get off the Facebook and Twitter threadmill and spend more 
time on longer forms of communication. I joked that Blogging is like old 
media but personal blogging is the best of both worlds - it isn't driven 
by the frenetic schedules dictated by newer big commercial blogs and it 
doesn't have the overheads of old media; this isn't your job, it's your 
hobby. It's a place where you can flex your writing muscles and hone 
your writing skills, away from the gaze of your friends, family and 
co-workers. How personal will you get? It's up to you.
