Some films compel you to form opinions about them. They pique your
interest in some way.  This doesn't always happen immediately, it
often takes days or even months to let a film soak in.  Respiro is a
film I can't be bothered writing about right now - nor I imagine in
the future.  It has plenty of cheerleaders anyway (there is an
unwritten rule that all foreign language films must be handled with
kid gloves by english-speaking critics, no matter how inconsequential
the movie is). It is breezy, authentic and superbly acted but
... unengaging. I suspect enjoyment of this film, depends on how you
feel towards Valeria Golina's troubled character. I came out of it
thinking "What a self-centered Charlatan !". But that's just my
opinion.
