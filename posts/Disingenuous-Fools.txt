Question: What do Bear Grylls and Robert Scoble have in common?  
Answer: They're both [Disingenuous][2] Fools whose schtick is appearing 
to be less intelligent than they really are so they can appeal to a 
broader audience. It's all about attention.
I watched Bear Grylls' 25 best moments on TV last night. I knew I 
shouldn't but I did. Grylls' schtick is that he's an intrepid explorer 
willing to do anything to survive. The reality is he's a TV personality 
willing to conjure up any scenario which requires him to drink his own 
wee. He will go half way round the world to the Australian out-back just 
so he can have an opportunity to drink his own piss. Along the way he is 
ably enabled by his camera-man and crew. I think his first step to 
recovery should be to stop hanging out with camera-man and crew and his 
other piss-drinking 'enablers'. His second step might be to submit 
himself to the very public humiliation of a 'Born Survior'/'You Are What 
You Eat' cross-over and surrender himself to some Gillian McKeith TLC. 
Imagine the scene - Bear's dining room. Hundreds of bottles of urine 
cover the dining table. Gillian stands hands on hips and scorns "Look 
at how much Piss you drink in a year! Look at it! Are ye proud of 
yourself? Are ye?"... But I digress. Bear Grylls is infuriating because 
he appears foolish but obviously isn't. There are probably enough people 
on the planet who watch his show and take him at face value to make Bear 
Grylls a very wealthy man. Me I find his earnestness grating. There are 
still others who see through Bear's disenginuity and are OK with that - 
the show is after all, entertaining. I'm not one of them. The 
Disenginuity is an irritant. It struck me that Bear Grylls irritates me 
in much the same way Robert Scoble does and for the same reason.
## Daddy, What's a Robert Scoble?
Scoble was an early blogger and gets a disproportionate amount of 
attention from other tech bloggers. A couple of years ago he was banned 
from facebook for running some auto-friending bot (Facebook wouldn't let 
him have more than 500 freinds, Bad Facebook, Bad). When he was banned 
he went about bawling all over twitter and his blog saying he felt 
'Invisible'. This was one of the most followed tech bloggers bitching 
about feeling 'Invisible'. That's pretty much all you need to know about 
Robert Scoble. 
Lately he has thrown himself (like Bear Grylls leaping from a bi-plane 
into the arid lifeless Sahara) into Google's G+ social network. He says 
he has [moved all his available time and blogging behaviour to 
Google+][1]. Never mind that even the dogs in the street know this is a 
stupid move, that's not the point. Scoble knows it's stupid too. But you 
don't get attention by threading carefully in this blogging/attention 
game. Scoble will - at some point in the future - have yet another 
[Pauline conversion][3] and will publicly and loudly lament his decision 
to move all his blogging to someone else's platform. This is how Scoble 
operates. Which is why I stopped following him many years ago. His Modus 
Operandi is to make bold (and often stupid) moves - like for example, 
doing all your blogging on Google+, then a couple of months later, do 
the opposite and declare his intentions in a way which suggests this is 
some god-given insight. There's only so much eye-rolling these poor old 
eyeballs of mine can take. I bear no ill will towards the man, it's just 
that - like Bear Grylls - I wish he'd stop pretending to drink his own 
koolaid/piss and be straight up about his own game.
