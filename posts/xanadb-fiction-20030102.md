# Mother Of Pearl
## 2003/01/02 23:00

It was April, no one came here in April, just Tim and his mother. The
beach was strewn with flotsam and jetsam. The sky was overcast, it
might rain any minute. He stepped tentatively around a large clump of
seaweed, poked it with a sand-encrusted stick, and was startled when a
large crab scuttled out and made for the water's edge. He followed the
crab, tapping its rear with the stick whenever it stopped. As he
approached the water's edge his mother called him.

"Tim - come here"  
He could barely hear her, above the din of the crashing waves. He
turned around and was about head back to the dunes when he noticed
something lying on the sand. A Jellyfish. He had never seen one
before, except in books. The largest 'Lion's Mane Jellyfish' were
longer than blue whales, but this one was smaller than that. He
stopped and knelt down to get a closer look. It didn't look like any
Jellyfish he'd seen in the book. It wasn't a Man-o-War, it didn't
appear to have tentacles. He prodded it gently with the stick -- it
didn't move. He looked closer, Its body billowed out on the sand,
translucent except at the rim where it was milky white. Its skin was
etched with innumerable grains of sand. Tim felt the sand between his
toes, and wondered if it irritated Jellyfish, all that sand under the
skin. He got a second stick, lifted the stranded Jellyfish into the
water and waited. Water lapped over it for a moment or two before it
began drifting, imperceptibly at first, further from the water's
edge. Tim watched its body, almost invisible in the shallow water,
billow gently, like a bird in slow flight. He watched it move
gracefully towards the distant breaking waves until Jellyfish and sea
became one, then, feeling the first heavy drops of rain, he turned and
ran all the way back to the dunes.

He couldn't tell where the idea had come from, was it his own or
something he'd read in science fiction? It nested in his mind for
years - an accretion that absorbed all his learning, all his reading
and study. He rarely allowed the idea to come to the forefront, he
couldn't, it was a crazy idea and he was after all, a
scientist. Although he never consciously entertained the notion, it
grew over time, hidden in the darkest recesses of his mind, a pearl
growing in clarity and beauty. 

When the idea was fully formed it pushed itself into his consciousness
with the force of an epiphany. Even then, his scientific mind refused
to be persuaded until external forces, discoveries by eminent
cosmologists and quantum physicists began to suggest that the idea
wasn't so crazy after all. Once he had proved it to himself, after 4
tortuous years of experimentation, the question was, how to present
his theory to the world.

The world science fair. Day 5. The Carl Sagan Auditorium. 

Tim Briton stood up and walked confidently to the podium.  
"Ladies and Gentlemen. Colleagues. The last 50 years have been turbulent for
us. We have been buffeted by waves of discoveries, each new discovery
contradicting the last. Every 5 years, our ideas about the universe
are wrenched asunder. We are constantly being told that everything we
know is wrong. Regrettably, today I must inform you once again...

...Everything you think you know is wrong

Our theories on the age and expanse of the universe are at odds with
one another. Is the universe still expanding or has it begun
contracting? There are strong arguments for both cases, observational
data suggests both, but the truth is, we simply don't know.

In the last 10 years we discovered that some fundamental constants,
the Gravitational Constant, Einstein's Cosmological Constant, the Fine
Structure Constant - Alpha, the expansion rate of the Universe -
Omega, values which we assumed to be fixed throughout the known
universe, aren't so constant after all. They fluctuate. Why they
fluctuate, we don't know. Explaining this, has become the single
greatest challenge of physics. 

Our early theories regarding particle physics are defunct. The notion
that we are composed of discrete atomic particles, was just that, a
notion, a useful temporary prop in our search for understanding. Today
we know that interactions at the quantum level can be felt in the
furthest stars. The subatomic particles in our bodies are in thrall to
distant stars. We are, all of us, swimming in a quantum ocean. And we
are not alone."

A low murmur rose from the audience. Tim expected as much and took a
sip of water before continuing. An image of The Milky Way appeared on
the screen above him. A box was etched around one of the outer arms of
the galaxy.

"We have incontrovertible evidence to suggest that fluctuations in the
constants are a local phenomenon. By local, I mean local to our solar
system and approximately 1,000 neighbouring stars. An area covering
15,000 square light years."

There was more murmuring, some of disapproval. Some scientists were
now pointedly leaving the auditorium.

"The fluctuations are the result of an undulating field of strong
gravity encircling this area of the galaxy" he said pointing at the
box on the screen.

"We have reason to believe that this gravitational field is
hemispherical in shape and that it is hollow, like a cereal bowl."

There were a few howls of derision. Many more stood up and left the
auditorium.

"We also have reason to believe that the field is moving, and that it
is moving with purpose, towards the center of the galaxy".

A collective chuckle rippled through the auditorium. Tim expected
this, how could it be any other way? Hadn't he laughed at the idea
himself?

The screen showed the box moving in a slow spiral towards the galaxy's
incandescent hub, its path intersecting each spiral arm in turn.

"The edges of the field appear to move in an undulating manner, while
the entire field itself... appears to expand and contract every 400
years...with minor contractions... occurring every... 56 days" By now
the hubbub in the auditorium was deafening, there was no point in
going on. The noise and the camera flashes blotted out all other
details.

It quickly became known as "The JellyFish Theory" Tim Briton had never
used that term himself but it was convenient to the Media and the
world at large. It would not have attracted such controversy except
for those 2 crucial words, 'with purpose'. The theory was dismissed
out of hand by most of the world's eminent cosmologists. Biologists
thought it was a joke.

"Hi, your watching Science Today on PBF with myself, Robert Huxley, I
have with me today, Tim Briton famous for his 'JellyFish' theory. Tim,
welcome to the show, I'll start with the obvious question. You
describe the phenomenon in your theory as 'moving with purpose', can
you explain what you mean by this?"

"What I mean is that the field is not moving in a manner that would
suggest it is the subject of any gravitational force. It is not being
pulled to the center of the galaxy, nor is it moving in a manner which
would suggest propulsion by an external force. It appears to be
moving, entirely of it's own volition."

"Mr. Briton, are you suggesting that this object, which you say is
billions of miles in diameter, is alive?"

"It is not an object, it is not composed of matter, it is a
gravitational field, whose approximate shape is that of a cereal
bowl."

"... or a JellyFish"  
"Yes, or a JellyFish. I do not want to imply that this is a biological
lifeform, unless we broaden our definition of what constitutes
life. It is drifting through empty space, it exists in the freezing
vacuum of interstellar space. It has no mass that we can detect, it
has no nervous system that we know if. The only analogy that can be
drawn with biological life is that it has a skin, of sorts."

"What do you mean?"  
"A entity of the scale we are talking about, orders of magnitude
greater than any living organism we know of, would have no need for a
skeletal structure or any of the conventional structures we associated
with even single cell lifeforms. Being of such an immense size,
gravity has an infinitesimally small effect on it, not even stars can
alter its course. Assuming that the field is in fact a living entity,
don't go looking for a brain or nervous system because they simply
aren't there. At least not in the spatial dimensions. However, it
appears to be bounded by a field of strong gravitation"

"Can you explain please?"  
"Yes, It's 'skin' if you would call it that, is a field of
gravity. The field may be composed of dense dark matter, whatever it's
composition, the field is of uniform thickness throughout and is
approximately 2 million miles in width"

"That's a thick skin!" quipped Robert Huxley.  
"Yes, though it's extremely thin when you consider the skin stretches
over 15,000 light years of space"

"Can you express that in terms of miles?"  
"It makes no sense to do so."  
"But for our non-technical viewers?"  
"It's bigger than you can possibly imagine"

"Hello, you're watching Larry Chung Live on CMN. Today I have with me,
Cosmologist Tim Briton, in the limelight recently for his
controversial 'JellyFish Theory' which he thinks, explains many of the
questions that have befuddled cosmologists and quantum physicists in
recent years"

"Mr Briton I'd like to start by asking, what can be done about this
'force field'? What measures can we take to protect ourselves against
it?" 

"Not much, I'm afraid. At any rate, I don't think it poses any danger"  
"Why do you say that?"  
"Our sun and all our neighbouring stars were engulfed by it, many
billions of years ago, before Earth or any of the planets were formed"  
"What are you saying?"  
"I'm saying we are already in the belly of the beast, we have been,
since the beginning of recorded time. If the field meant us any harm,
it would have done so by now"  
"So, we are already inside this thing?"  
"Precisely, It passed through our sun and is currently passing through
the spiral arm at about 400,000 miles per hour, engulfing other stars
on its long journey to the center of the galaxy"  
"What do you thinks it's purpose is?"  
"Other than that it appears to be heading towards the galaxy's core, I
don't know"  
"Is it intelligent?"  
"I don't know. All I said was that it appeared to move with
purpose. That is not to imply that it is living or intelligent by any
definition."  
"So you don't think of it as a life form, as evidence of alien life?"  
"If it is living, because of its size, it is not a life form we can
ever hope to engage with in a meaningful way. Our planet is not even a
speck of dust next to it."  
"Is it the closest thing to God?"  
"I don't want to speculate about that. I'm a scientist, if people want
to worship it, that's not my business."  

---

The room was dimly lit. High ranking military officials sat opposite
him. He shifted uneasily in his chair and took some more water. One of
the officials stood up.

"Mr Briton, we would have appreciated if you had brought this to our
attention before announcing it to the media. I won't feed you the
usual 'in the interest of national security' line, I realize this
problem is bigger than any one nation, but you understand that the US
government has a vested interest in the safety of its citizens and
does not like that safety compromised by widespread panic."

He tried, but Tim Briton could not suppress the smile, inappropriate
as it was.

"Sir, I understand your concerns. However, it is my firm believe that
the phenomenon poses no threat to America or any other nation."  
"Mr Briton, I respect your personal opinions, but it is our job to
safeguard America against all potential enemies. Therefore we would
like your cooperation in planning countermeasures against the
phenomenon."  
Tim Briton smiled and rubbed his eyes.  
"There are no countermeasures. There is no weapon or force in
existence that can change its course."  
"Are you sure?"  
"What have you got? Biological Weapons? Nuclear Weapons? Is there
something else you've been keeping secret?"  
"No, what we need from you Mr Briton, is an estimate of how much
destructive force, in Megatonnage, would be required to destroy this
thing if it were needed."  
"Sir, how shall I put this... a Supernova is the single most
destructive natural force in the universe. When a star, like our own
sun, explodes, it releases the same energy as the world's nuclear
stockpile many billions of times over. A Supernova is like a pin prick
to this thing. That is what we are dealing with."

Slowly, the 'JellyFish' theory took hold. Astronomers were the first
to begrudgingly accept it. The observational data concurred, so in the
absence of a better explanation, they had to adopt the
theory. Biologists began, slowly, to re-evaluate the criteria by which
life could be defined. Eventually a few quantum physicists offered
their support. Tim Bruton found himself talking less and less on
daytime talk shows, and talking more often at symposiums. The
'JellyFish' theory was studied closely by the most eminent scientists
of the day. A plan was proposed to deploy a telescope beyond the
bounds of the field, southward (in galactic orientation), and
perpendicular to the spiral arm. Outside the field, better
observations could be made, which would hopefully provide a more
accurate picture of the universe. It quickly became apparent that our
image of the universe was distorted. Hubble V would be the most
ambitious unmanned mission ever undertaken, a journey beyond the
confines of our immediate universe, a leap outside the fish bowl.

The Planetologists were slow to adopt the theory. They needed
convincing. Tim Bruton didn't think of the phenomenon as a living
being. It moved purposefully, that was all he had said, but those
words haunted him. In the collective psyche, the phenomenon had become
a living thing, worshipped by some, feared by others. As scientists
from different fields, marine biology to quantum physics, studied his
theory, one thing became clear, there were so many analogies with
living organisms, it was easier just to think of it as a living
being. Ironically, the single greatest discovery, the one that would
change humanity's perception of itself forever wasn't made by Tim
Briton, but a marine biologist who specialised in the metabolism of
deep sea jellyfish.

"Hi, your watching Science Today on PBF with myself, Robert Huxley, I
have with me today, Biologist and Cosmologist, George Dunne. George,
welcome to the show, I understand you have studied the 'JellyFish'
Theory in depth."

"Yes I have. Spectroscopic data suggests that only some stars in our
observable universe have planets. Interestingly those stars with
planets all lie in the path of the 'Cosmic JellyFish'. They are all
stars through which the 'JellyFish' has passed, that is, stars which
are or have been engulfed by the phenomenon. If we observe stars
outside the path, stars which have not yet been engulfed, none of
these stars have planets. One can only conclude that Planet Formation
does not occur as commonly as we thought. Planet Formation, may not
even be a natural occurrence in the Universe at large and in all
likelihood, Planets are only formed as a result of their stars being
engulfed by the 'JellyFish'. 

If we think of the 'JellyFish' as a living entity, which I think we
must, then like all living entities it must consume energy to
survive."

"How does a lifeform 15000 light years in size, feed itself?"  
"With stars, Robert, with stars. The 'JellyFish' feeds on stars the
way a blue whale feeds on plankton. It is quite elegant really, the
very largest feeding on the very smallest."  
"So planets then are the excrement?"  
"No Robert, the JellyFish, has no metabolism, it consumes a fraction
of energy from each engulfed sun and efficiently uses all that energy
to propel itself through space. Planets are not a by-product of
consumption, rather they occur as a result of the JellyFish passing
through the Sun. The outermost rim of the JellyFish, is an undulating
gravitational field. When suns pass through it, large quantities of
mass are thrown off, mass which later forms into planets. Planets are
the spoor of the JellyFish, its passing scent. A vapour trail. That's
all"  

---
It happened so quickly. Within days every radio telescope on the
planet pointed at the same narrow band of sky. Who would have guessed?
Who could have known? Not only were we not alone in the universe but
soon, very soon, we might actually be able to engage meaningfully with
an alien intelligence. It was so much easier now. Planets only formed
where the rim had engulfed stars. Intelligent Life could only exist
where planets had formed. It was a simple matter of examining the
trajectory of the 'JellyFish', calculating the precise location of its
outer rim along the trajectory, pointing the telescopes and
waiting. The high altitude dish at Aracebo was first to pick up the
signal, very clear, very distinct. A progressive sequence of numbers
encoded in binary...
