# You just unlocked the 'Annoying Git Who Tweets Foursquare Check-ins' 	Badge
## 2010/02/14 02:24:43 
I've been unkind to Foursquare users on twitter. I will readily admit 
that the whole Starbucks-Foursquare-Twitter love-in turns me into one of 
those [Grumpy Old Men &#153;][4] on the telly. The phenomenon is nascent but 
trust me - if you don't yet know what I'm talking about you soon will 
and, depending on your lifestyle, you'll either hate it (if you're the 
kind who prefers to have a quiet pint to yourself) or love it (if you 
like Starbucks&#153; and you like Twitter&#153; then you'll love FourSquare&#153;). 
[Aside: Foursquare is a webservice where you can check-in every time you 
visit participating coffee-shops and other locations. It's basically a 
'Location-based social loyalty scheme'. When you "check-in" you get 
points which might be used for a discount. You also alert other 
FourSquare users of your location meaning if a friend is nearby they can 
pop in to share a coffee & chat. When you "Check-in" those alerts also 
go to twitter, meaning all your twitter friends also know where you are.] 
Annoying as the proliferation of "I'm at Starbucks, [location] on 
Foursquare" messages are, seen in purely informational terms, they can 
be thought of as [headers][1] where the [payload][2] is a serendipitous 
offline face-to-face chat. (The question I often ask myself is "What 
would [Claude Shannon][3] think of X?" where X is Facebook, Twitter or 
any of the new communication tools that have sprung up in the last few 
years). 
What prompted the change of heart was a tweet by Damien Mulley (in the  context of a tweet with a link to his own blog )
> [Govt blows &#128;4M+ on website, then shuts it down, webstats too expensive so none available: http://url.ie/509m](https://twitter.com/damienmulley/status/9002002732)
This was his  follow-up tweet... 
> [There, sorry to be spammy but getting max mileage from the morning shoppers](https://twitter.com/#!/damienmulley/status/9002013393)
The idea that occasionally linking to your own blog is somehow 'spammy' 
doesn't sit well with me. Again, looking at it from a Information-Theory 
perspective, his earlier tweet was a header, the payload being his blog 
post (which by the way you should read). Some things take more than 140 
characters to say and - for better or worse - Twitter is becoming the 
place where people talk. I guess my real gripe is with people who use 
twitter exclusively for [Out-of-Band][5] communication. The people who 
only use twitter as a distribution medium (I don't even think this can 
legitimately be called SPAM since you don't have to listen). If all I 
see in your Twitter stream over the past few days are FourSquare 
check-ins to Starbucks then I'll unfollow. (It doesn't mean we're not 
friends any more. Twitter's infantile "You are no longer friends with 
So-and-so" really annoys me. We're all grown-ups. 'Following' is an 
indicator of 'Interestingness' not just 'friendship' - they can often be 
mutually exclusive.) 
So in future I promise not to be so crabby about out-of-band stuff on  Twitter. Except for Qik - that stuff will rot your brain ;-)
