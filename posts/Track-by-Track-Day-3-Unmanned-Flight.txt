[Saganism: Unmanned Flight](sounds/03 Unmanned Flight.mp3)

This was another track written specifically for _Ode to Voyager_. Yes, 
that is an arpeggiated marimba, the last refuge of the [IDM][2] scoundrel. 
This is one of the more accidentally complex tracks on the album. 

Initially I was luke-warm about this but it has since really grown on 
me. It's plucked guitar and arpeggiated marimba weave in and out of one 
another with a 3rd keyboard propelling it along one chord per bar. 

That's it really - 3 instruments and no drums. It's surprisingly sticky 
for such a simple composition. This was put together in my kid's 
playroom one afternoon. The kids were pottering about, playing and I had 
headphones on but there was a lot of background noise. It was only when 
later when I heard the playback I thought it was any good. Again, the 
idea was to evoke feelings of solitude and isolation. I think it works.

You can download or buy [Saganism: Ode to Voyager][1].
