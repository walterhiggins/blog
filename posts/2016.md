So ... 2016. I haven't posted on the blog for a couple of reasons - Kids, 
Family, Work, much-needed time away from screens - the usual.

## In Books
A last minute holiday in Lake Garda in the middle of summer gave me some 
time to read. I remain skeptical of eBooks so brought some paperbacks in 
my luggage.

### Flowers For Algernon - Daniel Keyes
This was _really_ good. As with 'Dune' and other Science Fiction 
classics, it's been on my radar forever (since I was 10 years old at 
least) but I only got around to reading it this year. Given it was 
written in the 60s (like Dune) it has aged really well. It's very moving.

### Fairy Tales - Hermann Hesse
I read a lot of Hesse in my teens/early 20s and 'Fairy Tales' has been 
sitting on my shelf for a couple of years. Maybe I've outgrown Hesse but 
this collection of short stories was not as good as I hoped. Siddharta, 
Steppenwolf, and Demian remain three of my favorite books.

### Brave New World - Aldous Huxley
This was a re-read. I first read this in 1989 - I was 18 years old at 
the time and the world was very different then - it blew my mind. It 
hasn't aged well over the intervening 27 years. There's still some 
interesting ideas but it feels a little 'Jules Verne' now.

### Seveneves - Neal Stephenson
This was a long read. It's contemporary science-fiction set in a 
not-too-distant future where the moon shatters, prompting a race against 
time to create an off-world survival ark. The first 2 thirds of the book 
are riveting, the last 3rd not so much.

### Helliconia Trilogy - Brian Aldiss
I began reading this on and off a couple of months ago but haven't yet 
finished it. It's good but I just don't seem to get the time to read as 
much as I'd like.

My own book [Writing Minecraft Plugins in Javascript][book] hasn't 
exactly been flying off the shelves. Computer books of a technical 
nature tend to have a short shelf-life and become obsolete, that's why - 
for much of my book - I focus on teaching Javascript (which isn't going 
away anytime soon). The latter 3rd of the book introduces Java and the 
CanaryMod API which sadly is no longer being actively developed. 
Nonetheless, [ScriptCraft][sc] works just fine with SpigotMC which _is_ 
being actively developed.

## In Running
I finally bit the bullet and signed up for a Marathon in 2016. I did it mostly because it was getting weird having to explain to friends and colleagues (who know I run) why I hadn't yet run a Marathon. I did the local Marathon (Cork City) in June. It was hot and hilly, I wasn't as prepared as I could have been so the arse fell out of it around mile 10. I finished in 4 hours 52 minutes. Definitely room for improvement.

I ran just [over 1,000 miles this year][strava].

## In Work
This was my 6th year at IBM. The work continues to be interesting and the people are great. In an industry that has its fair share of sociopaths, I've never encountered any at IBM. Maybe I've just been lucky but the people I've worked with at IBM have been an all round decent bunch. This year I ran a couple of NodeJS workshops in Cork and Galway. Hopefully in 2017 I'll devise and run an AngularJS workshop, among other things. Our project migrated to using Git for revision control recently. It's been an interesting move. Git is a revision control system that exposes a lot of its internals - so much so it can be thought of more as a revision control construction set. If revision control systems are your thing, you'll _love_ git. I've been making a concerted effort to master git over the past few weeks. Despite having a github account for a couple of years, and maintaining a repository (ScriptCraft) with 100s of forks and 1000s of stars, I never really understood git until very recently.


## In Miscellaneous

I _finally_ got around (just this morning actually) to updating all of my domains to use HTTPS. It was much easier than I expected thanks to [LetsEncrypt][le].

This Christmas I haven't spent as much time working on ScriptCraft as I'd hoped. I do feel a little guilty about not coding in my spare time - but not _that_ guilty.

Instead I've been playing video games - the latest generation. There was a family surprise underneath the Christmas tree this year - a Playstation 4. It's been 9 years since we last got a console (Nintendo's Wii), and 18 years since I got a 1st generation Playstation - so yeah - it was time.

I've been playing Star Wars Battlefront (in split-screen mode with my son Sean) and TitanFall 2 which is every bit as good as I'd hoped. I got Metal Gear Solid V but haven't yet played it very much. Rocket League is also good chaotic fun.

Hope you all have a great 2017.
