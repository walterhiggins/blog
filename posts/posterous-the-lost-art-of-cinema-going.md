</a>... The answer ... not many. Those few independent cinemas all seem to be film-club / art-house cinemas. In Cork the cinema-going experience has gotten both better and worse over the last decade. Multiplex cinemas like Mahon Point have comfortable seating with an unobstructed view of the screen and are for the most part clean. On the other hand, The Kino - the only "art-house" cinema in Cork - has long since closed its doors.</p>

<p>I hate the arthouse/multiplex fault-line that has sprung up over the past twenty years. Fucking hate it. It's bad for cinema and bad for cinema-goers. I lived in San Sebastian in the early 90s - today it still has a world-renowned film festival held every year. What you don't hear about are the smaller film-seasons held throughout the year in San Sebastian's many independent cinemas. There was an old theatre in the old town (I don't recall the name) which showed plays, gigs and movies. One week it might show a season of Sam Fuller movies, the next week Bram Stoker's Dracula, A few good men or whatever the latest mainstream movie was. I fondly remember watching Hal Hartley's 'Trust', Sam Fuller's 'White Dog', and Terence Davies' 'The Long day closes' ( a film which has made an indelible impression on me, despite having only seen it once 18 years ago) in that particular cinema. It wasn't an "art-house" cinema. There was nothing pretentious about it. To be honest that phrase (art-house) only entered my vocabulary when I returned to Dublin and discovered that foreign language / low budget movies could usually only be seen in The Lighthouse or IFI (The Screen on Townsend street was the exception to the rule - it always had a good mix of movies).</p>

<p>I fucking hate being coralled into one or other cinema because Art House cinemas don't show mainstream movies and vice versa. Who the fuck decided good foreign language movies were only suitable for beard-stroking pseuds anyway? This arthouse/multiplex distinction has only grown starker over the past 2 decades. This isn't healthy. On the one hand you have Multiplex owners who don't have the balls to screen good independent non-hollywood movies because they think that ... well I don't know what they think. On the other you have well-intentioned but under-achieving "Art" project cinemas with no real ambition or interest in attracting a broader "mainstream" audience. Does it have to be this way?<p /><strong>Lucky Bag Cinema</strong></p>
<p>If I had the time and money I'd build a cinema. Not a multiplex, not "Arthouse" - just a cinema. It would show 2 or 3 movies every week. Some old, some new. All genres and demographics welcome. I'd call it the Lucky Bag Cinema - or something like that. It would have comfortable seating, would serve popcorn and soft-drinks, have an airy seating area / cafe out front where you could sit and chat with friends after the show. Given the huge back-catalogue of great films which most people have only seen on TV, there would probably be more old movies shown than new ones. No arthouse or film-student pretensions. Just good movies. <br /> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/fustar/status/50144413829169152"><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</a><br />According to John (<a href="http://twitter.com/fustar">@fustar</a>) the costs of screening even old movies is prohibitive so this might be too expensive even for someone with lots of money. I don't know - maybe a guerrilla pop-up cinema might be the way to go. Clandestine screenings of old and new classics in abandoned warehouses up and down the country. It might work. If someone is already doing this, let me know. The whole rave scene passed me by. I wouldn't want this to pass me by too.</p>
