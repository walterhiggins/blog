# Irish Blog Raspberry Awards
## 2009/01/27 09:00

Next month almost 300 people will gather in Cork to celebrate the best
of Irish Blogs at the Irish Blog Awards. I think I can safely say that
blogging has grown up and that we're big enough and mature enough to
shine a light on the soft underbelly of Irish blogging. Yes it's time
we celebrated the <em>Worst</em> of Irish blogging. I propose the
following blog categories...

<ul>
  <li>
	 <h3>Most ponderous blog post.</h3>
	 <p>
		A couple of years ago in a previous blogging life, when I was
		at my navel-gazing prime I would have been a shoe-in. Any blog
		post with the word 'Semantic' in its title should automatically
		qualify. Also any blog post titled 'Why I'm giving up blogging' -
		you just know these people are needy attention seekers desperate
		for validation. It's time we gave them what they want.
	 </p>
  </li>
  <li>
	 <h3>Most self-regarding blog post.</h3>
	 <p>
		What's it all about? Fucked if I know but one thing I can assure
		you is you won't find the answer by reading the self-regarding
		blogger.
		If you are tired of any of the following you automatically
		qualify...
		<ol>
		  <li>Facebook (it's sooo 2007)</li>
		  <li>Twitter (it's sooo 2008)</li>
		  <li>Jaiku (it's sooo lonely here)</li>
		</ol>
		This award will be called the 'Carrie Bradshaw'.

  </li>
  <li>
	 <h3>Worst Photo-blogger.</h3>
	 <p>
		... because not everyone is Anton Corbijn.
	 </p>

	 <p>
		Yes that's me sucking a lemon. No I don't remember who the photographer was. 
	 </p>
  </li>
  <li>
	 <h3>Worst Music blog.</h3>
	 <p>
		Do you embed youtube videos of 'Sigur Ros' and 'Animal Collective' in your
		blog? You're in.
	 </p>
  </li>
</ul>
