<p><strong>On Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Despite being both the recording artist and distributor I have no control over how much iTunes, Amazon MP3 and Napster charge for the album. None whatsoever. The price I set on BandCamp is a 'Name your own price' with no minimum. I think this is the fairest pricing structure for an album that was recorded at home with not a great deal of expense. If you download the album from BandCamp you can do so for free or pay what you think is a fair price. So far the average price the album has fetched on BandCamp is 5 Euro (a fair price I think, but I have no problem with downloading it for free, I just want people to hear it). I've been buying music for almost 30 years now. The first record I bought cost me 7 punts (about 9 Euro) and I can remember the bad old days of the late 90s/early 00s when I bought some CDs for as much as 23 punts ( a ridiculous price for a single album but it was hard to find, despite being a new issue) in Tower Records in Dublin. Thankfully iTunes has brought some sanity back to music pricing. It's been almost 2 years since I bought my last physical CD in a record store. I've been buying my music (and lots of it) online at <a href="http://7digital.com/">http://7digital.com/</a> and <a href="http://emusic.com">http://emusic.com</a> since. It took me longer than most to give up on the physical CD but I've let it go. All my CDs are now in the attic.</p>
<p><strong>How to Distribute your music on iTunes, Amazon MP3 etc.</strong></p>
<p>It's easier than I thought. Much easier. Open an account at&nbsp;<a href="http://members.cdbaby.com/">http://members.cdbaby.com/</a>&nbsp;, pay them $39 USD and upload your music and artwork and they'll sell it on cdbaby.com and distribute it to all the big online music stores. Pay them another $20 and they'll throw in a barcode (essential if you want to eventually go the physical route and press CDs for sale in stores). Told ya it was easy ;-)</p>
