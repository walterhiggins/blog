# Mid-Career Perl ## 2014/03/11 11:12Chromatic on being a Perl programmer in the middle...> Look, I'm a programmer. I solve problems. I've managed teams and I've > been managed. I've written documentation and I've written tests. Some > days I've deleted more code than I've written and I've been glad of it. > Some days I've solved customer problems by not writing code. Some days > I've been elbow deep in profiles or Valgrind reports and other days the > best thing I've done was add an index to a column in a database and it > was totally worth all of the research to reach the point where that was > the solution.  > -- [The Mid-Career Crisis of the Perl Programmer - Modern Perl Programming][1][1]: http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2014/02/the-mid-career-crisis-of-the-perl-programmer.html?## CategoriesPerl, Programming
