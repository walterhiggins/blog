[Snowball Fight Mini-game in Minecraft](http://youtu.be/DDp20SKm43Y)

Behold! The first minecraft mini-game written in Javascript. The 
mechanics of starting the game are a little crude I admit but the game 
has become a bit of a hit with the small sample of players who've played 
it so far. The game is called Snowball Fight (imaginative - I know) and 
it involves teams firing snowballs at each other. The aim of the game is 
to hit as many opposing team members as possible before the clock runs 
out. You gain points for hitting opposing team members and lose points 
if you hit one of your own.
 
The code behind this is tiny - at the time of writing - [less than 100 
lines of javascript][1]. The aim here is to inspire kids (both young and 
old) to create their own mini-games so I wanted to start with something 
that's small and simple but still a lot of fun. I already have plenty of 
ideas for how this game could be improved and have another game in mind 
(pig-pong - teams must herd pigs into a pen using carrots). 
 
Playing games can be fun but programming games that your friends will 
enjoy playing? - that's a whole different level of fun.
