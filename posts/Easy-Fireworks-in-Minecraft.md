# Easy Fireworks in Minecraft## 2013/06/23 18:57I finally got around to adding fireworks to ScriptCraft. I basically cogged the code from a [bukkit forum post][source]. There's a new `fireworks` module with a single `firework` method which takes a single parameter (of type org.bukkit.Location). Of course, I've also added a Drone 'firework' method to make it easy to create a firework. The simplest way to create a firework is to point at a block, then type ....    /js firework()... Will create a firework of random type and color. If you want to create a few fireworks...    /js firework().fwd(1).times(10)... will create a firework, move forward one block and repeat the process 10 times. Fireworks have also been added to the `arrows` module so now you can equip yourself with a bow, then type...    /js arrows.firework()... and start shooting arrows to your heart's content. You can see the results in the video below...[Fireworks using Scriptcraft](http://youtu.be/DJxPPk9ODiE)You can [download the ScriptCraft plugin here][sc].[source]: https://forums.bukkit.org/threads/spawn-firework.118019/[sc]: http://scriptcraftjs.org/## CategoriesScriptCraft, Minecraft, Fireworks
