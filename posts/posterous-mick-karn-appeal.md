<h2><strong>MICK KARN  APPEAL - Posted 4th June 2010</strong></h2>
<p><strong>With great sadness we regret to inform you that Mick  has recently been diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer. Mick  is currently in a positive mood and undergoing further tests and  treatment. His family and friends are close with him, supporting  him in practical ways, and surrounding him with their love, friendship  and care.</strong></p>
<p>Mick has been struggling financially for some considerable time  now and we are hoping that this appeal may help to raise funds  for any necessary treatment and perhaps go some way towards providing  a small degree of financial support whilst Mick's immediate family  provide the care and comfort we would all wish for him. We are  hoping that his friends, fans and musical colleagues will, over  the coming months, offer any support they feel capable of giving.  Quite aside from the sheer brunt of daunting medically-related  costs, Mick's clear and major concern is for the security and  well being of his wife and young son.</p>
<p>If you would like to make a donation whether as an individual  or as a group, you can do so via the paypal link below which has  been set up for this sole and express purpose. Any support you  are able to give, no matter how small, could make a difference  in helping Mick cope during this difficult period. His friends  will be looking at a variety of ways to raise funds.</p>
