  <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">In the past I've tried to say, 'Look, we are all crappy superheroes,' because personal computers and mobile phone devices are things that only Bat Man and Mr Fantastic would have owned back in the sixties. We've all got this immense power and we're still sat at home watching pornography and buying scratch cards. We're rubbish, even though we are as gods. I think the idea that we can all be superheroes if we want might still be contagious, like in <em>V For Vendetta</em>. I've heard of urban superheroes springing up across the world. I think there's one in London called Angle-grinder Man... I think he removes clamps from cars and things like that. They have them in America as well, apparently. And like in the same way serial killers would be caught with The Bible on them or a copy of John Fowles's The Collector, there is a common link between vigilante heroes: all these little urban superheroes have copies of Watchmen!</blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://thequietus.com/articles/04603-alan-moore-interview-unearthing-2">thequietus.com</a></div>
