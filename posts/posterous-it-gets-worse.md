  <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>'It is a fact of life' that Ireland will no longer be a low tax economy over the next ten years 'after what has happened', according to European Commissioner for Economic &amp; Monetary Affairs Olli Rehn.</p>
<p>The Commissioner was responding to a question at the informal meeting of finance ministers in Brussels on whether Ireland's low rate of corporation tax should be included in any moves to increase tax revenues in Ireland in order to bring the deficit down to 3% by 2013.</p>
<p>He said he did not want to take any precise stand on the matter since it was a matter for the Irish Government.</p>
<p>However, he 'didn't rule out any option' since we know that 'Ireland in the coming decade will not be a low tax country, but it will rather become a normal tax country in the European context.'</p></blockquote>
