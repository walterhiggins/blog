We are capable of great things. We can create wonders.

Sometime around the turn of the last decade, something wonderful
happened. The web became a place where regular people could live. They
set up websites and blogs, places where they could stake a claim, give
voice to their passion. Up to that point the web had been a place for
corporations, just another outpost for strident corporate
advertising. It took us a while to realise this vast new territory was
habitable by ordinary people too. That you didn't have to be
incorporated and have a multi-million dollar budget to establish a
presence on the web. For a brief moment in time, it seemed like
anything was possible. Then we forgot. 

Shortly after the early frontiersmen of the web began settling, others
joined. As capable as the first wave of [frontiersmen][f] who made
their own web publishing tools, whittled from XML regular expressions
and [glue][g], this second wave saw the web as a place to build not
[homesteads][h] but [suburbs][fb]. A place where people could live
without having to worry about [plumbing][rss] their own homes.

## Back to the land

For too long I've felt the pull of the earth drawing me back. The land
is calling to me. It smells of [plain-text](posts/back-to-basics.txt), ftp
and baked HTML. It is self-hosted and self-publishing. The tools I use
to publish are simple: [Emacs][e], Perl, [Markdown][md] - just
enough Lisp and Perl to get by. Where I'm going there are no badges,
widgets or 'like' buttons. No promoted tweets or banner ads. Only
words and pictures and links. Back to basics.
