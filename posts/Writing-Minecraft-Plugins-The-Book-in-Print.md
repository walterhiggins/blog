# Writing Minecraft Plugins - The Book in Print.## 2015/04/18 07:47Yesterday, author copies of [A Beginner's Guide to Writing Minecraft Plugins in Javascript][bk] arrived in the post. A courier dropped by with a cardboard box of 24 copies, and an additional copy in a Jiffy envelope. My youngest had some friends over for his 9th birthday and couldn't wait for me to get home, so Ursula took out the first copy from the Jiffy. To be fair I would have asked her to do this anyway when she called me on the phone. I was like a kid at Christmas when I got the call.![first copy with box](images/sc-book-pkg.png)What follows are some photos and short notes on the book. As you'll probably guess, I'm a bit of a bibliophile. I *love* books - not just technical books. Having my very own technical book with my name on the cover is, well ... something. ![src](images/sc-book-src.png)One of the things I explain early in the book is Modules. The commonjs module system (used by Node.js and ScriptCraft) is the most concise and elegant module system I've ever used. Teaching modules and modularization is usually an afterthought when teaching programming to beginners but it's such an important part of programming and it's done so well in CommonJS that I wanted to cover it in the first half of the book. ![modules](images/sc-book-modules.png)The book is in full color throughout its 310 pages and is printed on high quality paper.![full color](images/sc-book-full-color.png)Source code listings are - for the most part - short. This screenshot shows one of the medium size code listings - an example use of Javascript's `switch` statement:![code listing](images/sc-book-switch.png) The book has many different types of content, source code listings, tables, diagrams, screenshots, side-notes and so on. ![elements](images/sc-book-elements.png)This is a full page table and source-code listing on opposite pages.![table](images/sc-book-table.png)[Peachpit][pp] have done a wonderful job on the production of this book.The cover, spine, paper quality and layout are what you'd expect from a publisher that specializes in Photography and Education.This book looks and feels better than I dared imagine. ![section](images/sc-book-section.png)I'm a big believer in books - *actual physical books* - as a way to learn and be inspired. I tried to write the kind of book I would have wanted to read when I was 12 years old and just starting out programming. I can only hope now that this book ignites the programming spark in readers and maybe - just maybe - inspires some of the next generation of programmers.[bk]: http://www.peachpit.com/store/beginners-guide-to-writing-minecraft-plugins-in-javascript-9780133930146[pp]: http://www.peachpit.com/## CategoriesScriptCraft, Writing, Minecraft, Javascript
