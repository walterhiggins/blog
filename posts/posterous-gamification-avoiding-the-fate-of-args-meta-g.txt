<p>the meta-game is a great <a href="http://whatgamesare.com/2011/01/you-need-a-marketing-story-marketing.html" target="_blank">marketing story</a>. It seems to be the point where games cross over, become the art of the 21st century, and it has the character of the futurist. Meta-games have also repeatedly proved fertile ground for Hollywood (such as the recent Tron sequel, or eXistenZ) and cyberpunk novels, which then keeps the idea alive.</p>
<p>The story is very appealing, particularly to a very specific set of markets. Those markets are press release hounds, PR people, cross-media watchers, game academics, theorists, technology geeks, futurist artists, advertisers and media students. The kinds of people that attend or speak at conferences, basically.</p>
<p>The meta-game promises the next level, meaningful experiences, artistic relevance and transcending from mere day-to-day gamemaking into something that ordinary people will find magical. All of these and more are really powerful draws for conference types because the reason we go to conferences is to catch a glimpse of tomorrow.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/tiedtiger">Tadhg Kelly</a> on why meta games don't scale. It's really really good so go read the whole thing.  <br />Now. <br />Tadhg is writing a book 'What Games Are'. His blog is some of the best writing on Games I've ever come across.</p>
