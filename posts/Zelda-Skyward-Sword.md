# Zelda : Skyward Sword

It's getting pretty high praise all round. A score of [94/100 on 
metacritic][1]. Despite owning a Wii and a GameBoy early in the early 
90s, I've never played any of the Zelda games. This - I'm pretty sure - 
marks me as some kind of freak among gamers. I reckon this is probably 
as good an introduction as any to the Zelda series. I'm hoping this will 
be underneath the tree on christmas morning. I've already begun dropping 
non-too-subtle hints at home. The only question is - can I wait until 
christmas to play it?

The one dissenting voice among the game review websites is [GameSpot][2] 
which gives it a lukewarm 7.5 out of 10. That less-than-glowing review 
has garnered a stunning 2,300+ comments alone - most of them from angry 
Nintendo fan-boys aggrieved that the reviewer hasn't given it a 10!
