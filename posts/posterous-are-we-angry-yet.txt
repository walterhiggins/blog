  <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>In a similar sense, the way our Government has given us the bill to bail out foreign creditors is akin to telling the Irish people - many of whom didn't borrow a farthing and have nothing to do with the banks - that we the people are solely responsible for the Irish banks, rather than the banks' creditors, who actively lent to them.</p>
<p>Not only is the economic cost too much for any nation to shoulder, but the Irish people are not responsible for the behaviour of private banks licensed in Ireland by the European Central Bank.</p>
<p>The Irish bank reparations are financial lunacy and they are politically unacceptable. Anglo's results yesterday only substantiate this view.</p>
<p>Is there any way that Irish society can cope with the bank reparations?</p>
<p>Ireland's bank reparations will cost us &euro;26,315 per worker in the economy. Is there any way that social peace and cohesion can be maintained when the average worker - who is entirely blameless - is being asked to cough up &euro;26,315, while every foreign creditor, who is (in large part) to blame, is being subsidised by the average worker?</p></blockquote>
