I'm five years late to the party but I've just finished playing Portal. 
What a Game!
It was available on Steam for the Macintosh for just 8.99 or 18.99 euro 
for the Orange Box (Portal, Half Life 2, Team Fortress & HL EP1 and EP2) 
so I bought the Orange Box. I haven't really been paying attention to 
Games these past couple of years. GoldenEye for Wii reignited my 
interest last year. Portal was released in 2007 so by gamer standards 
it's old. I didn't know much about it but assumed it was just another 
First-Person Shooter. I was wrong. Many thousands of words have been 
written about this game - its writing is smarter and funnier than any 
other game I've ever played. The ending is very very special. I'm still 
grinning thinking about it. It's a glorious end to a brilliant game. 
Demented, Funny, Sad and Brilliant - I loved every minute of it. To get 
a feel for what the game is about go read Tim Rogers' review.

GlaDOS, the computer who oversees your every move in the game, is one of 
the most brilliant villains ever written (in any medium, games, books or 
cinema). She'd eat [HAL 9000][2] for breakfast.
