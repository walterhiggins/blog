# The Fifth Floor Revisions

"...and they all lived happily ever after. The End."  
After a polite round of applause, Tom Driscoll sat down and waited for
the critique to begin. This was only his fourth session with the
writer's workshop. He was still unsure of his audience. Leo Hertzfeld,
the workshop moderator stood up. 

"Well, I must say none of us expected that ending, a total surprise"
he said without a hint of irony.

"I liked it, very... postmodern" Liz Grant chimed in.  
"I felt the ending was a bit rushed" added Tony Lee.  
"What about you Alan, what did you think?" asked Leo.  
Alan Smithe was new to the workshop. This was his first session. He
was a small mouse of a man who somehow managed to make himself almost
invisible in the small room. He had introduced himself meekly earlier
that evening, a tiny voice that seemed to plead not to be greeted in
return.

"Very cleverly written, but it's obviously a pack of lies" he
replied.  
"Well this is a fiction workshop" said Leo looking around the
room. There were a few chuckles.  
The critique continued. The rephrasing of a sentence here and there,
cut and paste a paragraph from there to here. The story was massaged
and reshaped. All the while, Alan Smithe watched them carefully. Tom
Driscoll, ponytail and earrings in leather waistcoat and black
denims. Leo Hertzfeld, the moderator. Leo didn't appear to have strong
opinions about anything, he watched his group while nodding pensively
with each comment. Liz Grant, mid 30's, slim, jet-black short hair,
wearing a smart figure-hugging suit, she looked like she came here
straight from work. Tony Lee, still in his 20's, a published writer no
less. Alan Smithe fixed each of them with his bulbous eyes, and waited
his turn, his manuscript clutched between both hands.

"...all in all, a good piece Tom, keep it up..." said Leo.  
"...Alan I see you have a piece, as this is your first session, you're
under no obligation to read but..."  
"Yes, I would like to read my story" Alan said, standing up.  
He seemed to grow in stature as he approached the center of the
room. He looked at each member of his audience in turn then cleared
his throat and began...

Alan Smithe stopped briefly to sip some water. He took two gulps of
water from a tumbler. For an instant his tongue pressed against the
bottom of the glass, like a grotesque slug. He put the glass down and
continued...

> The End

Alan Smithe looked up from his manuscript. There was a polite round of
applause, and Leo Hertzfeld stood up. 

"That's very good, Alan. You can sit down now. Who would like to begin
? Bear in mind, it is Alan's first session so go easy" Leo said.  
"I have a question..." Tom piped up. "... What is 'specialling'?"  
"'Specialling' is a term the hospital used for the special attention
the staff sometimes needed to give to certain patients. Patients who
were depressed, suicidal, incontinent or immobile" Alan answered.

"But wouldn't that be done by Nurses ? Trained Nurses ? In your story
it appears the cleaning staff and night porters do this - they would
hardly be qualified"

"There were cutbacks in the health budget - they had to make do" 

"Well you might at least want to explain what 'Specialling' is" Tom
added.  
Alan Smithe looked Tom in the eye then quickly scribbled something on
his manuscript.

"A good point Tom, now who would like to add something?" Leo said.
Liz Grant looked deep in thought.

"...Liz?"  

"Where to begin, Alan I like Horror stories but there's something
missing - You've given us clues but you haven't followed up on them,
there's no payback for the reader" Liz began.

"For example?" asked Alan.  
"The old lady that the main character is 'specialling'. We're told at
the start of the story that she can't sleep and needs company and
that's it? Where's the follow-through? Why bother telling us this if
it has no bearing on the story? At least tell us a little of her
story."

Alan nodded while scribbling furiously on his manuscript. He seemed to
have been seized by an Idea too good to forget.

"And the language Alan, Its very florid, very H.P. Lovecraft, I'd tone
it down a little and another thing - lose the arms and legs stuff, its
juvenile" she added.

Alan simply smiled and nodded in agreement.
"Tony ?" asked Leo.
Tony watched Alan take notes. There was something disconcerting about the fervour of his note-taking. He began hesitantly.
"Well, it's a good piece. A lot of promise. Some nice prose. Gave me a
chill in places. It's very nice but..."

The only published writer in the group, they were hanging on his every
word.

"...nothing happens, it's a non-event, she hears some stories, steps
into an elevator, ends up on the wrong floor, comes back down a floor,
she doesn't tell anyone and leaves her job, end of story, big deal. Be
bold, you've built up all this expectation but haven't followed
through - what is the light that's moving towards her - is it a ghost
or perhaps a knife-wielding maniac ?" 

"That would be pretty far fetched" Alan interrupted.

"But it's a ghost story!" Tony replied. 
"No it's not - it's a true story - it really happened. I'm not trying
to tell a ghost story. I'm telling a story about the effect that ghost
stories have, the tricks our mind plays on us when we're alone in the
dark"

"That's very admirable but you've presented it in the framework of a
ghost story - readers will expect a ghost"

"Some stories just are. They don't exist to meet reader's
expectations. This is a true story - it really happened - If I
embellished it with a ghost I wouldn't do it justice. The story, is
what it is. I just get to tell it."

"Another issue I have is the ending. It's premature. There's no real
closure. The character should later find out that there were no
security patrols on the 5th floor that night."

"...premature...ending" Alan wrote on his manuscript.

"Other than that it's very good. Very promising ! Overall I liked it"
Tony added hastily. 'Nutcase ! - Leo should vet new people' He thought
to himself.

"What about you Leo?" Alan asked.  
"I liked it. Promising. Nice prose." Leo said.  
'Coward' thought the group.  
Alan's story was the last story of the session. They agreed to meet
again in the same place in 4 weeks time. Each of them would have new
material to present.  
That night Tom Driscoll slept fitfully, Alan's story playing over in
his mind. He dreamt vividly, the smell of disinfectant and old
linoleum haunted his dreams.

"Tom ! Tom !" It was an old ladies voice. "Tom wake up !" 

Tom awoke. He had fallen asleep in the chair by the bed. The old lady
was crying again, her face turned away in shame. His nose quickly told
him why. He lifted his heavy frame from the chair, tried not to
breathe in, and set to work. The old lady sobbed openly all the
while. She had been like this for more than a year, but each time it
happened, each time she lost control, she sobbed. Tom wondered how
much more of this he could take, how much more she could take. He
opened a window. A chill September breeze blew in, it was cold but it
was better. 

"I'll close the window in a minute, just making things more
comfortable for you, that's all" he said. The woman was frail, a
breeze like this could lead to pneumonia. He put the thought out of
his mind. It wasn't his place to think such things. She was a
religious woman, that much he knew. They had become close over the
past year. Despite her troubles she never talked about ending it. Not
even in her darkest moments. Tom decided months ago that if she asked
for his help in doing so, he would oblige regardless of the
consequences. No one should be made suffer like that. But what about
Tom? His worked weighed heavily on him, he was untrained. The last
patient had broken his spirit. The days and nights had become an
endless succession of changing bedclothes, spoon feeding, cleaning
floors and restless sleep. Caring for these poor souls, dead in all
but the medical sense, one felt there was nothing to hope for. They
had no families, no visitors, just Tom. When his last patient jumped,
Tom considered suicide. An easy end to it all. The old lady wouldn't
allow that now.  Tom changed the sheets and gently put the old lady
back into the bed. He closed the window and drew the blinds.

---
"Tom is that you?" Liz Grant said feebly.   
"That's better now isn't it?" Tom replied.  
She motioned to wipe a tear from her cheek with her right hand,
remembered it wasn't there and wiped her cheek with her left hand
instead. She would never get used to it, the maddening itch that could
never be scratched. The doctors called them "Ghost Limbs", Amputees
often thought they felt feeling in their missing limbs. It was a trick
of the mind. While the nerves no longer existed, the part of the brain
where the nerves ended, still registered sensations.

"It's cold" she said.  
"I just closed the window"  
Tom couldn't rid himself of the smell, but at least the old lady had
stopped crying. 

"Would you like me to read you a story?" he asked.  
"Yes, sure, why not"  
He picked up a book by the bedside and began reading.  
"The case of charles dexter ward ... by H.P. Lovecraft..."  
The old lady began sobbing again.

"Good evening Sir" the doorman greeted Tony Lee.

Tony nodded as he passed and headed for the elevator. He was tired. He
had grabbed a bite to eat at a local restaurant and decided he
wouldn't attend any more sessions. He wasn't getting anything out of
the writer workshop anymore. His first novel had garnered critical
praise and was selling well, he'd moved on. Besides, standards were
slipping at the workshop, who was this Alan Smithe guy anyway ? 

He pressed the 'Up' button and waited. While waiting, he briefly
considered taking the stairs. He laughed at himself. The elevator
doors opened and he stepped inside. He never paid attention to how the
buttons were laid out before. Numbers 1,3,5,7 laid out in the left
column, 2,4,6,8 in the right column. Someone could conceivably press 5
by accident if they wished to go to the fourth floor. Tony Lee's
apartment was on the 5th floor anyway so he pressed '5'. After a
moment the doors closed and the elevator shunted upwards.

Tony Lee wasn't completely surprised when the elevator doors opened
upon a cold dark corridor. 'I'm tired' he thought to himself and
rubbed his eyes.

When the icy breeze wafted in, he slapped his cheek as if to wake
himself.

"OK" he said aloud and stepped tentatively out of the elevator,
zipping up his jacket against the cold wind blowing through the
corridor. Wherever he was, it wasn't his apartment block. The floor
was weathered linoleum, the walls were painted olive green, chapped
and flaking. A mop and bucket rested against one wall just a few feet
away, next to the bucket was a small puddle of urine. He couldn't see
much further in the darkness. He heard blinds flapping in the wind. 

This was too real. He quickly stepped back into the elevator and
pressed '0' then '>|<' to close the doors. A gust of wind whipped
round the elevator doors. Tony Lee lifted the collar of his jacket and
stamped both feet against the floor. He had only been here less than a
minute but was already freezing. He pressed the '0' and '>|<' buttons
again. Nothing. 

"Shit!" he said, pressing every button on the panel. The elevator was
dead. He stepped out into the corridor again and decided to look for a
stairway. He could hear, at the end of the corridor, blinds being
whipped wildly in the wind. A broken window, he guessed. He braced
himself against the breeze and headed towards the broken window. Where
there's a window, there's a stairwell. The corridor stank of animal
urine. There was no point lighting a match, the breeze would blow it
out quickly. He could only see a few feet ahead of him. Once he had
decided to leave the elevator and find a stairway, pragmatism took
over. He couldn't afford to think too much about his situation, just
get the hell out of it. On either side of the corridor were doors with
bobbled glass panes, the kind of glass that made the prettiest face
look grotesque. Each glass pane had a number on it. He dared not try
the doors. If there was a stairwell it would most likely be at the end
of the corridor. He thought he saw movement at the corner of his eye,
something behind the doors? He quickened his pace, fumbling along the
right wall, stepping in puddles, tripping over what he hoped was a mop
head. He got back on his feet, he could see moonlight shining through
an open window just a few feet away. He ran to the window. Blinds
flailed wildly in the wind. He could see street lights outside, there
was no traffic, no people on the streets. It didn't look like anywhere
he knew. He looked around for a stairway but there was none. He gazed
out the window, looking for signs of life when he saw reflected in the
window pane, a large looming grey form behind him. The hairs on his
neck and forearms stood on end and he spun around. 

Tony Lee had never seen a ghost. He was now convinced that anyone who
claimed they had was lying. The spectre was more terrible and
terrifying than he could ever have imagined. An old woman, 7ft tall,
her head horribly misshaped. She leared at him, bearing teeth that
weren't human. Her breath was malice. She stooped low and hissed in
his face, clasping his chin in two claws, matted with thick black
hairs.

"Is... this... what... you... expected?" she hissed.

Tony Lee's mind froze. The air itself crackled with menace. Every
particle, every atom of his surroundings intent on bringing harm to
him. Not just killing him, even death was natural, but bringing harm
to him, an unnatural harm he could not imagine. The claws drew
back. The spectre stood upright and lumbered backwards into the dark
fixing him with its grotesque eyes.

## _Epilogue one_

The doorman found him on the stairway, curled up in the foetal
position. He didn't say a word. The doorman called an ambulance. He
was eventually admitted to a psychiatric hospital. He was let out a
few years later. He went into hospital for a knee operation and threw
himself from the fifth floor, he had just turned 40. Some would call
it a premature end. The porter who was minding him at the time, took
it very badly. He strangled his next patient a year later. He claimed
he was doing her a favour. He took his own life the following day.

## _Epilogue two_
Leo Hertzfeld waited one whole hour for the other members to show
up. They didn't show up that month. Or the month after that.

---
## _Epilogue three_

Today, Alan Smithe is the director of a number of Hollywood movies,
none of which have received critical acclaim.
