# Goldeneye 007 for the Wii. What a game!

<p>I'm not a fan of First Person Shooters (FPS). The last FPS game I played before Goldeneye was Quake 3 Arena. That was 11 years ago.</p>
<p>Needless to say, FPS games have come a long way since then. Although I hadn't played FPS in 11 years I was FPS-curious during that time. Shortly after christmas 2010 I succumbed and bought GoldenEye for the Wii. It was kind of a lucky accident really. I was going to buy Call of Duty: Black Ops but it was sold out. I never played the original Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64 so I don't know nor care if the Wii version is faithful/better than it. What I can tell you is that I absolutely love Goldeneye for the Wii. So much so that it has recently reawakened my interest in gaming. I played it all the way through to the end ( a first for me I think) &nbsp;in single-player mode and had an absolute blast. I've played it in split-screen paint-ball mode with my kids. I've had my arse kicked the few times I played it in online multiplay. I've no doubt I'll play through the single-player campaign again at some point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Goldeneye is stealthy. You get to sneak up on bad guys and bring them down with a hold and twist of the neck, sneak around them altogether to avoid detection or just go in guns blazing. I love the stealth aspect of the game. I've since played Call of Duty: Black Ops ( CODBLOPS &nbsp;for short ) and it can't hold a candle to Goldeneye - the sense of movement, distance and 'heft' in Goldeneye is unsurpassed. Which is not to say that the game is perfect. There's a couple of things missing in Goldeneye...</p>
<ol>
<li>Split-screen co-op play. Me and the Kids against NPC ( Non-player character ) bad guys. That would rule.</li>
<li>Combat-training. Ala CODBLOPS. A handy way to hone your skills before playing online against ruthless predatorial human players who have more free time on their hands than you do.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>If Activision brought out a Goldeneye II with just these added features I would gladly pay for it. The experience of playing Goldeneye from start to end was something special. I liken it to the month I spent watching all 5 seasons of The Wire, or the weeks I spent reading Ian M. Banks' 'Culture' SF books.&nbsp;</p>
